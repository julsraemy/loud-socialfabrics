Looking at the timeline on the charter.,""... My background is in information retrieval. So discovery. I've worked on search engines, SRU (searching on online library catalogs)."",… Getty is looking to reimplement its internal search. Including IIIF. In the next 12 months.,""Antoine:  R&D manager for Europeana. Data interoperability for 10 years, especially with semweb technology. Interest comes from Europeana's mission to make content accessible -- a big index to CH content.  Looking at revising the ways we ingest and harvest content.  Contribution is mostly coordination -- help the group succeed and that europeana and partners are represented"",""Ben: DH software consultant. Editions, transcriptions. Images to text. Last year we built Pontiiif for crawling and discovering. Lots of lessons and issues. We'd like to share. We also had crowdsourcing. We'd like to have more formal ways for IIIF discovery.I'll advocate for a IIIF discovery API"",Drake [inaudible],Glen: Nat Lib Wales. Sharing content with Europeana using IIIF. Building internal websites on top of IIIF. Re-using some sitemaps. Interested in increasing (re-)use. E.g. Welsh aggregator: People's collection (https://www.peoplescollection.wales/),""Jason: improving discovery of special collection on the web. Implemented Schema.org, developed our Blacklight site and quicksearch (??). I want that my faculty hears the great stuff you have and we don't. Maybe not be involved in core work of the group. But we can be quick to implement experimental features and see how they work."",Jeff: interest as publisher of III-related content. Discovering connection between our content and other IIIF content worldwide. Experience with Linked Data Notifications.,Johannes: software (mostly back-end) dev. BSL will expose most its content in IIIF and we want to make it more discoverable. We have some time to develop prototype. Extend an OS application that we could extend into a IIIF search engine.,Julien: librarian/archivist/ Mostly observer. Interested about UX/usability patterns. Doing a thesis about Mirador and Universal Viewer.,Mark: product owner for a project of a discovery layer for archival collections. Also interested in harvesting/synch of IIIF resources. Esp. when manifests and Collections are updated and patterns for surfacing that. Possible helping for prototypes. Not 100% sure.,Mel: software engineer. Making sure our content can be consumed by external aggregators. We're still discussing. Also in terms of involvement,""Matt: OS development around IIIF. We've got a IIIF content search for a platform that indexes annotation and fulltext. Interested in all aspect of IIIF discovery. Can contribute software dev time. I've built a harvester as part of our testing around IIIF search, for harvesting very large collections all the way down to image annotation level.   Forgot to mention, I've built a harvester as part of our testing around IIIF search, for harvesting very large collections all the way down to image annotation level"",""Nuno: computer science and metadata aggregation (Repox used in Europeana). Aggregate metadata exploring IIIF solutions. Started case studies, one of them with NLW (Glen) enabling Europeana to harvest IIIF collections using Sitemaps and extensions. Interested in getting more standard solutions that we can implement in Europeana network. Expect to contribute with case studies and tools on the aggregator side (discovery and harvesting). Johannes and Mel are natural partners for us too, maybe we can prototype with them!"",Regis: providing unified access to images and data for manuscripts/early books. Using IIIF manifests from multiple institutions and exposing IIIF collections. Implemented drag-and-drop into our UI. Experiments with IIIF for archives and Gallica. As an aggregator we will benefit from discoverable IIFI resources. We are willing to implement recommendations from this group.,Sheila: IIIF community and comm officer. Interesting IIIF surrounding IIIF. Will be part of this group to provide support and contribute as much as I can.,""Simeon: history (painful!) with OAI-PMH and (less painful!) w/ ResourceSync. Participate calls, testing, editing of specs. Cornell would be ready to implement on the source side of discovery solutions."",Tom Crane: help our client to implement IIFI discovery so that their resources are discovered. We also build search platforms. We're keen on exploring UX aspects of search and browsing. People building/citing IIIF resources. Crowdsourcing and internal site around material. Which requires finding stuff. Want to make sure the software we develop aligns with specs.,""Toronto (Sian Meikle, Dickson Law, Jana Rajakumar, Rachel Di Cresce): Plug-in for Omeka, a wrapper API to provide services for scholars.

Making sure external systems can find set of links to go where IIIF resources are. """"This is where you can go to get all my stuff"""" "",""Indexing. Separate from crawling/harvesting. Tools can be built separately. Moreover the presentation API is not about semantics of data but presentation. (Semantic) search is not sthg we can do.

Very basic level characteristics.,ACTION: Ben to take the matter (call 22 Feb) to the discussion group.,Rob: are we happy with the charter as it stands?

Layers of hierarchy above the sitemap to deal with collections, including overlapping collections (sets in PMH minus the issues with them). Extensions provide options for fixity, descriptive, linking, technical (size, format) and change history for each resource.  Bigger extensions:  Instead of complete list end to end, also the ability to describe set of changes over time to support incremental harvesting.  List of 1M URIs, datestamps, checksums, file sizes is pretty large. To get that set and check against the local copy of the 1M things is non trivial.  Especially distributed over 20 files of 50k (a sitemap limitation). Will have institutional collections in IIIF that exceed 1M items.  Change logs allow more rapid synchronization -- more efficient.  Also mechanisms for dumps of complete sets of content -- maybe not a big use case for us.  Cost of making many connections is high, so lots of small things is expensive to sync.

Metadata pointer to manifest. Right now we can do it based on id tokens in record but it only works if there is contextual understanding of system in which data is residing."",Jason - I want to be able to give the tools to publishers and aggregators in certain communities so they could build a vertical search engine to say i am only going to search manuscripts for example. Manuscripts community needs to decide how we are going to identify that it’s a manuscript in the manifest and then agree on what metadata they will have to allow conveyance of knowledge that it is a transcribed resource. Details belong in the community but the tools and patterns belong in IIIF - does that make sense?,""Rob - yes, that’s a great clarification. Slight tweak to 26: as transcriptions in IIIF are anno lists, whereas the metadata that is domain specific (manuscript vs. journal) - those two components are living in different spaces. We already decided that rich searching in metadata seeAlso is a search engine specific problem.If you understand METS for example you can build a lovely search engine that can find you very specific resources. However, we do have search API for discovering textual content in annotations on canvases and manifests, which is where transcriptions would live, so that’s already accounted for. But is this the intersection between wanting to find manifests that have particular metadata properties AND IIIF layer of annotations that are described as transcriptions as opposed to other commentary?"",Mike - web anno spec don’t include that granularity. We could add motivations that are common and would be useful for discovery.,Rob - look at IIIF issue 511: https://github.com/IIIF/iiif.io/issues/511 ,Antoine - would this be an issue for other groups? discussion/feedback about what kind of motivation would there be out of the box - is that something for the text granularity group?,Rob: That would be a great home for the issue :),""Mike:  in Text Granularity we don't have any of the semantics of what type of text, just the source."",Jason - text granularity thing is in some ways very similar - another level of granularity on what type of annotations you have,""Mike: Have translation, commentaries, etc.  Thinking of the granularity use cases as OCR granularity, but also would have translation done at page level.  Would be good to distinguish the broader context."",""Jason: If we can figure how to solve that well, it covers a lot of different use cases. "",Rob - to really cross the group streams - would this go to AV group with distinction between captions and subtitles?,Jason: I think it would cover those sorts of things.  Don't think the mechanism has been talked about enough as to how to know programmatically how to use those particular type of annotations.  Could capture lots of differences like captions vs subtitles.  Lots of things we could do if we had that.,Rob - we should raise this to broader community as an issue and suggest that AV and Text could align some practices but this is not itself a discovery group issue,Jeff M: +1,Mark M: +1,Randy:  +1,David: +1,Simeon: +1,Mike +1,""Jason:  +1.  It will enable different types of discovery, but isn't discovery itself."",Antoine - so today this is out of scope for this group?

Also question re: content types."",""Simeon: if last-modified dates are problem, that’s tech independent. Recent version of ResourceSync means that last-modified is not the only way to do synchronisation, e.g. via ETags or hashes. So date not fundamental."",""Trey: does this mean that I’d get URI from Sitemap and then have to make HTTP HEAD requests to get the additional info? That seems problematic, or slower than the alternative."",Rob: what benefit does this have over ResourceSync?

Walk backwards, ignore references to things already processed or deleted."",Simeon: what if there is no good change record? How could you use ActivityStreams? Publish everything as ‘Updated’ -- basically serve as resource list?,Simeon: ResourceSync thought solidly about this. Might be replicable though on a notification technology model.,Antoine: is this more a focus on the notification side of the charter? Machinery quite complex? Is ResourceSync simpler?,Jeff: different question re: letting people know re: new activities. ,Antoine: focus on dynamics of the data.,Jeff: an initial activity could be associated with an object. ,Mike: do we have to go through them in chronological order?,Trey: do we have to parse the whole stream to get back to where we were?,Mike: start with most recent until you hit the event you left off at. Not necessarily a problem. But where is the initial list?,Jeff: initial publication snapshot events in the stream.,""Rob: benefit rather than challenge. One description that needs to be understood for: the resource list, the change list, and the notification list. Single technology, multiple uses."",""Trey: could be comfortable with this, if there’s a way to get to ‘list of all the things that exist’. Don’t want to have to parse 5 million events, many years down the line."",""Dave: harvesters might want to periodically touch base, rather than stay up to date with a continual stream of events."",""Rob: is knowing all of the changes a use case in the context of discovery? Or do we just want the most recent? Don’t care about previous states. If so, could delete old events whenever you update."",Antoine: could be communities who _do_ want all the events.,Trey: I’ve indexed the thing. I get the stream. How do I know that I need to update it?,Rob: time of event would be more recent than last checked. Like ResourceSync. Requirement: sorted so you don’t have read all events and sort by time. The representation needs to be sorted like a ResourceSync change log.,[Chat discussion re: hashes],Trey: there is no protocol. We’d have to come up with one.,""Rob: register stream somewhere, and resources that you GET from the web."",Protocol: changes between X and Y dates. Other options?,Trey: ‘where do I get this thing?’ defined in ResourceSync and maps.,Jeff Mixter has some questions re: ActivityStreams.,""If the recommendation is to only keep the most recent Activity - how does one get all originally created itesm? The solution could be to just pull everything again but that seems a bit odd - especially if some Activities are typed as something like ‘published’ and other are ‘moved’. Plus I think there is intrinsic value to knowing when an item was ‘published’, which would require that a ‘update’ Activity not overwrite the ‘published’ Activity."",I am uncomfortable with the idea of recommending that only the most recent Activities are kept. Seems a bit heavy handed and could paint us into a corner (with regards to implementation). ,""I understand the burned keeping and sorting all Activities but I would argue that the ‘keeping all the data problem’ is unique to the individual organization and the sorting issue could be solved by building/recommending a REST API spec for filtering/searching for Activities. If the latter is acceptable, then there is no reason to recommend deleting old Activities - rather the recommendation is to implement the REST API. Then it is up to the individual organization to decide how much Activity data to keep (though I accept this this freedom to decide what to keep could cause problems)."",Chat Log: ,""From Me to Everyone: (10:02 AM)

From Robert Sanderson to Everyone: (10:46 AM)
https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-move
From Dave Beaudet to Everyone: (10:47 AM)
Is there a requirement that the full dataset can be re-assembled by running through the history of the stream or could only certain fragments of activity be present with the understanding that a full sync happens periodically?
From Simeon Warner to Everyone: (10:49 AM)
If you have the COMPLETE change list...
From Dave Beaudet to Everyone: (10:49 AM)
exactly
seems there needs to be periodic re-syncing
From Jeffrey Witt to Everyone: (10:50 AM)
why can’t you have an initial activity called “publish” the object of which is your initial set
From Dave Beaudet to Everyone: (10:51 AM)
so long as """"initial"""" is """"periodic"""" it would probably be fine, but trying to rely on capturing every single change without any gaps could prove difficult
From Jeff Mixter to Everyone: (10:51 AM)
+1 to “publish” idea
From Dave Beaudet to Everyone: (10:52 AM)
Is notification pull or push?
From Simeon Warner to Everyone: (10:52 AM)
or an activity called “exists” which simply says that at this time the thing exists
From Simeon Warner to Everyone: (10:52 AM)
(avoiding any implied semantics with “published” or “updated”)
From Dave Beaudet to Everyone: (10:53 AM)
seems like you should only have to """"rollback"""" to the latest """"snapshot""""
From Jeffrey Witt to Everyone: (10:54 AM)
yeah agree with rob, i like that aspect
From Simeon Warner to Everyone: (10:57 AM)
for discovery just need last
From Jeffrey Witt to Everyone: (10:59 AM)
the date is different or the hash has changed
index 0 should be most recent
From Dickson Law to Everyone: (10:59 AM)
An idea: Should we just publish the hash to avoid semantics regarding edit times?
From Simeon Warner to Everyone: (11:00 AM)
It is like ResourceSync in JSON ;-)
From Glen Robson (IIIF) to Everyone: (11:00 AM)
I think it would be useful to see a mock up of this option.
From Robert Sanderson to Everyone: (11:00 AM)
+1 to mockup

There was a consensus in Toronto to explorer Activity Streams. Also Rob’s proposal to update the charter was accepted. 1a for IIIF services harvesters and 1b for other Web Harvesters. ,Matt said in Toronto he would develop a tool which would convert from IIIF Collections to activity streams: https://github.com/mattmcgrattan/iiif-activity-streams. It will also track last modification dates on manifests. Jason has tested it and it worked for him.,Question was asked if it could be hosted centrally by an aggregator? Not intended to be production ready but this could be developed into something that is run centrally. ,Jeff has also taken 1.6 million content DM manifests and converted them into activity streams and indexed these into elastic search. He has built an api on top of this:,http://52.204.112.237:3061/?action=range_search&fromDate=2017-10-10&toDate=2017-11-04&size=20,Hopefully it will be documented and released on github next week. Paging was an issue with so many results but if you add another parameter from=[number] will start at the nth number of results to enable paging. If people are interested in this type of approach then people can supply use cases to Jeff. Question would Jeff be supporting the Activity Stream collection approach? Not initially. ,Starting with paging would be good and then could look at an api later if required.,Jason has also produced an activity stream demonstration but not clear what the context should be. Also not sure which Date properties are the ones that should be used. Matt used startTime Jason was using published. Which one should an aggregator use? Should be something we collectively agree on. ,https://scrc.lib.ncsu.edu/sal_staging/iiif-discovery.json,""Matt also included a label, maybe we need some guidance on file size limits. E.g. Sitemaps say shouldn’t be bigger than 52mb and also shouldn’t contain more than x amount of results. If we had a label (for the manifest?) in the activity stream it will add to the size of the file. Maybe something to take to the iiif-discuss list. "",Need to think about recommendations for paging and other community conventions. Jason is going to send it to IIIF discuss by the end of the week. Moving questions to iiif-discuss got a plus 1 as easier to keep track of. ,Jeff’s found it was simple to create the Activity Streams and Elastic search interface. Python code to create Activity Streams and then send them to Elastic Search. Jeff is happy to help others. Jeff is happy to take a copy of AS data and add them to the ElasticSearch index. ,Glen has also done a mockup for storing links on the iiif.io website:,http://preview.iiif.io/root/discovery_list/community/groups/discovery/registry_as.json,It includes a list of institutions and is also available as a IIIF Collection and AS stream. Interestingly both this example and Jeff’s went for the actor tag to say where the collection came from. This might be important in the aggregator context. ,Jason also found it pretty simple to create the activity streams using code from Blacklight to generate a sitemap.,Jeff: Would be interesting to throw these AS streams into a triple store to see if people can query it directly. ,What would next steps look like?,Jeff make his code available,Jeff to get AS endpoints to index,Matt to do some more work on his convertor,Answer questions on implementations particularly what should a IIIF AS look like? Don't want to get into early versions that look different. Send this to iiif-discuss. ,More testing by aggregators (Nuno),Still need an example which supports Paging - Matt’s implementation does support paging:,https://mcgrattan.org/as/,Notes:,From Me to Everyone: (06:06 pm),""Matt, I can take notes"",From Matt (Digirati) to Everyone: (06:09 pm),https://github.com/mattmcgrattan/iiif-activity-streams,From Jason Ronallo to Everyone: (06:09 pm),worked for me,From Jeff Mixter to Everyone: (06:12 pm),http://52.204.112.237:3061/?action=range_search&fromDate=2017-10-10&toDate=2017-11-04&size=20,From Jason Ronallo to Everyone: (06:24 pm),Here's my very basic example so far: https://scrc.lib.ncsu.edu/sal_staging/iiif-discovery.json,From Me to Everyone: (06:27 pm),http://preview.iiif.io/root/discovery_list/community/groups/discovery/registry/,From Jason Ronallo to Everyone: (06:29 pm),""Yes, what do our ASs look like"",From Matt (Digirati) to Everyone: (06:35 pm),https://mcgrattan.org/as/,From Jason Ronallo to Everyone: (06:36 pm),Aggregator testing will raise further questions so a good direction.

We have seen several implementations and can say what the document says is valuable and useful. ,Need to write up as a specification rather than plan. Need more consuming implementations. Would be good if Cambridge and Brumfield labs could be updated to use it. We would then have 4 or 5 publishers and 3 or 4 consumers. This would be a good target to go for. ,Antoine would like to provide feedback on the spec.,""0.1 should be published for the Washington conference on the iiif.io website. Simeon, Mike and Rob think this is achievable. This tackles 1a of the charter (http://iiif.io/community/groups/discovery/charter/). "",1B harvesting by search engines. This probably involves recommending schema.org links to content although this is related to the viewer work. We have decided in the past to postpone this until last. ,""2. Content Indexing - this is pushing for a registry for identifying things like METS+alto, EDM, MARC etc. We might want to take it out of the discovery group as this group is currently more technical. Can take this out to the community groups. The Editors would like to have a 60 minute session on registries and cookbook session. This could be a useful discussion for the discovery group. "",Discussion on whether the charter specifies that we reach agreement on profile identifiers in discovery or if its just having the process in place that would make the charter a success. Community groups could be responsible for maintaining the registry. Things we need:,Identifier,Registry that collects these identifiers,Process for addition and management,""Description of the URI/profile (label, supporting community group, etc.)"",Framework in the specs to use the registry,Examples,""Could be difficult to keep this up to date. Europeana have struggled to main this list. Would outsourcing this to the community groups help this process? Aggregators may encourage certain formats e.g. Ill use schema.org because its used by search engines and mabe understood by Europeana. What happens if 30 different people submit different profiles of the same metadata e.g. EDM. CIDOC CRM should be sufficient rather than saying the LinkedArt profile.  Difficult to be arbitrate to say that your profile isn’t sufficient for the registry. Example of the Newspaper group recommending ALTO and other profiles seems to work. Seems we need to have a minimum number of sites implementing it. Would like to see a list of institutions or groups proposing it rather than individuals. “If you can’t point to two instances it doesn’t go in”. Could have text saying community groups are encouraged, smaller groups of three maybe added. "",3. Change Notification - have a couple of sample institutions experimenting. This could be the next item to focus on post Washington. Could lead to 0.2 of harvesting spec.   ,4. Import to Viewers - relates to 1B. We have a way of doing this currently but it is tied to a certain UI. We are currently short on developers. Should we look at Tom Crane’s jist and make this more accessible? There have also been developments in browser add-ins. How do we involved the software developer in this discussion?  ,https://github.com/IIIF/discovery/blob/master/source/api/import/0.1/index.md ,Glen to contact Tom Crane to get drag and drop spec. Can use next meeting to focus on viewers. Would be good to know by DC which direction we are going. Glen to see if Software Devs can be involved in next call. ,Will there be a discovery session? Yes at least an hour. Vatican wasn’t as useful as it could have been as there were lots of new people. Could do ½ update and demos ½ what do we need to do next? Reach out to Jeff and Matt  to do a demo of harvesting two or more activity streams and here is a consumer. ,Next call will be the developer call. Rob on vacation on the 4th of April. Meeting after the Editors will be in Princeton. Rob will try and work on harvesting spec before the 23rd of March. ",

While IIIF specifications discussion has focused on the machine-to-machine mechanisms of making IIIF resources harvestable (such as via ActivityStreams, ResourceSync or SiteMaps), the community has yet to assemble an end-to-end solution that demonstrates how discovery might be accomplished at scale and across a range of differing standards for metadata arising from libraries, archives, and museums.				"",""Stanford will conduct a several day workshop to begin efforts to devise the means to discover IIIF compliant images in each of the silos – libraries, archives, museums – and simultaneously to begin to build common understanding of converging discovery across those silos, recognizing that metadata standards, expectations of discovery possibilities by professionals and users of resources in each silo, and availability of common “solutions” for each silo remain numerous and vexing.”"",Topics to suggest:,Workflow and expected timeline,""Description of the API endpoints, as opposed to the format/structure"",How to encourage implementations and experimentation,Ask for examples from institutions -- manifests with seeAlso -- especially given the desire to talk about metadata,Distinction between Web Scale search engines and Domain Specific search,Relationship to SEO (schema.org?)

Went through Change Discovery spec, and no objections. Several questions, but towards understanding not technical issues.  Matt presented at EuropeanaTech the previous week in Rotterdam.  Also no issues, and a few questions.  Enthusiasm for the work."",Antoine:  Was there something about import?,""No technical questions in Washington, although there was clarification that it's import between systems rather than explicitly to a """"viewer""""."",""Stanford Workshop: Conversations with Tom Cramer in D.C. about concerns over the harmonization with the TSG's work.  The framework and work to date should be part of the framing of the event, rather than an afterthought.  Shouldn't fork the specs or derail the TSG work, but certainly can go beyond the scope in terms of discussion.  That was accepted.  "",""Issues around getting buy in for the work, content profiles and what the community might want to do in general.  Not addressed by work to date."",Matt will do plenary presentation at Stanford. Most concerns have been allayed but need to be attentive to the discussion scopes.,""Mark:  Understanding is to be complementary, but also include stuff outside of the TSG. Issues of harmonizing metadata, user focused discovery issues."",Rob: Clear signalling about what is IIIF and what isn't. ,Matt: Could be part of the process of forming new groups to do different aspects.,""Is there anything that we need to prepare in advance?  Work of Jeff, Jason, Matt etc. to demo systems rather than talking about curly brackets."",""Rob:  Presentation of the ecosystem would be important.  A demo would be very useful, but not sure there's time to build it?"",""Jeff:  Don't have seeAlso on the manifests yet.  Could put together something arbitrary to work just with ContentDM as I know the URLs for the internal metadata.  So could be hard coded to do the right thing -- crawl the stream, grab the metadata and index in Elastic."",We showed the AS prototypes and talked about Nuno's crawler -- will Europeana be there to show the crawler?,""Antoine:  Yes, we'll both be there. Will ask Nuno if he can demo his work. Could reprise the experiments he did quite early on with manifests. Should be relatively easy.  "",""Jeff: Put a lot of string based metadata into the metadata of the manifest, but could build a crawler, the manifest has enough metadata fields to do indexing."",""Matt: My publisher will work on IIIF collections, so could put up endpoints for collections with good seeAlsos.  Could thus make one for Wellcome, with seeAlso data. Would need half a day or so."",Antoine:  What do we need to prove? Do we need to go as far as indexing? ,Matt: Good question.  Would be useful to show the specs as written do a full trip through the ecosystem. Might not be useful?,""Jeff: Need to do this anyway, so had some time reserved next week to work on it. If you can point me to an AS endpoint with seeAlso, I can hammer away on that."",Rob: Build a small prototype with the different steps illuminated.,""Antoine: Audience should believe that the metadata can be indexed.  Would be super cool if it can be shown, but they should be okay with just the retrieval."",""Matt: Not sure how many people are IIIF insiders.  Might know about metadata or publishing content, but there's the Manifest vs metadata vs image distinctions.

Just need to hold the line.,Antoine:  Also not sure what user experience stuff will be discussed at the workshop.  The attendees seem more on the backend systems side.  I wouldn't push for it.,""Rob: Don't need to be too opinionated about what the """"right"""" UI / UX for search is."",""Antoine: Should we try to address the EDM / IIIF profile issue? Flagging IIIF resources in a larger profile?  Not really discovery of IIIF resources, but could be of interest."",Mark:  Sounds relevant to me.,""Rob: Likewise. Would be fantastic if people would step in to that area from different communities, hopefully also people not otherwise engaged with IIIF."",""Antoine: Will also talk about that, as well as Nuno's experiments.  Haven't been asked to talk about anything, but who knows how the agenda ends up.  Wouldn't want to overlap with Rob / Matt."",Matt: Would it make sense to have a presentation in general from the discovery group?  Talk about the europeana stuff as part of that.,""Jason: That sort of presentation based on large aggregator's experiences would be really valuable. Would help inform the work for the time, and set the stage towards community standards and be more broadly interoperable.  Besides harvesting, you also get this additional benefit for doing this. Many more reasons to publish the metadata."",Rob: An hour for presenting at the beginning? Matt then Rob then Antoine?  And then demos separately.,Antoine:  Good to separate to allow for questions?,""Rob: 3 * 20 minutes, plus 10 for questions = 90 minutes?"",Jason: That seems like the necessary context to be productive.,""Rob: timeline question: People may ask what is next: import viewers, notifications, content indexing, etc. Do we have a sense of what the answer would be?"",Jason: No :),""Antoine: Tried to do them in parallel, which meant things took much more time than what we thought.  Confident there will be work on notifications, less clear how to make things happen for import."",Matt: Hopefully workshop will kickstart content indexing / profiles work. ,Jason: That's the piece that gets driven forwards by this,Antoine: Also the schema.org stuff (1B).  Esp if we make the connection with the schema.org case we've worked on in the recent past. ,""Dave: Those discussions are going to have to happen at some point. Once the domains get busy talking about their data. Once you have it in the index, how do you get it out?  Profiles or not, it needs to be answered.  More important to answer that question than to have notifications.  More difficult to bring together multiple datasets."",""Jason: For 1B, good to reiterate the line there.  One of the more confusing pieces.  Can't avoid it, so should be proactive in stating it up front."",""Dave, Rob: +1"",Rob: Spend more time on that in the intro slides?,""Matt: Yeah that would be useful.  The longest discussions were in that area, with use cases etc.  Good to go over the reasons why we went that way.  "",Jason:  1A is where we can make progress and specs. Otherwise get stuck rehashing that.,""Matt: People may disagree, but need to get the explanation out in front of them.  Wasn't made arbitrarily.  "",""Jason: The earlier we can get it out in the discussion, the better."",""Rob:  Perhaps the timeline answer is:  You tell us :)  What are you prepared to help with, given the possible next steps of (SEO, notifications, profiles, import)"",""Jason: that sounds good, thereby asking for the help to get there"",""Matt: Touched on it, but what do we hope to gain in terms of input and moving the charter items forwards, getting more people involved in the process and evaluating the specs? What counts as good outcomes? "",""Jason: Getting item 2 moving would be good, getting different communities to discuss their profile identifiers. Discussion about where lowest common denominator / web scale vocabs fit in, for discovery across the areas.  Content indexing, relevant to seeAlso.   Maybe we find out what is practical / pragmatic as far as that goes so communities can achieve it, and it doesn't kick off a multi-year discussion about agreeing on metadata standards.  General understanding of crawling and harvesting works, and encouraging more publishers of the data and more experiments on the data, are the secondary."",Rob: +1,""Dave:  Having user story that goes end to end, having collaborators in different spaces come to some kind of agreement of what they'd be trying to achieve. And then use discovery to realize that, in partnership with an aggregator."",""Jason: Good point -- was thinking more about seeAlso, but for newspapers there's a lot of other data that could be used to power search. Might be more recommendations to make about how to publish it to be reusable."",Rob:  Maybe next time we talk through that user story and try to find institutions with overlapping data?,~~~ Adjourn",

Attendees included members of the IIIF community who attend the IIIF Discovery calls and invited experts on metadata and aggregation from Europe, Japan and North America. "",""The workshop was successful in making some progress. We started by hearing from various speakers on what existing aggregation and shared metadata standards exist before hearing what progress the TSG had made. Between discussions we had break out groups (10 people each) and developed ideas and reported back. There was great excitement for the demos from the Technical Specification Group and a concentrated discussion on registries. There were differing views on whether IIIF should host a common search interface and/or and/or specify a common descriptive metadata standard, such as Dublin Core. "",There was consensus in the end that the technical group is progressing well but there is a need to engage with the community groups to determine which metadata schemas are in use and encourage the communities to come to internal agreement on an identifier for that schema that can be referenced via a seeAlso link in the manifest.,Open questions raised during the meeting include: ,What responsibility does IIIF have to enable discovery? ,Do the IIIF-C or IIIF community have to do discovery or rely on others to do this? This could be IIIF providing a metadata API on top of a registry or by starting a IIIF Aggregator. ,Tension between people who want to discovery IIIF resources but also people who want to discovery resources and IIIF should just disappear. (should IIIF be ‘intel inside’ or more prominent to users),What does it mean for an end user to use IIIF? ,These discussions are continuing in the IIIF Discovery Specification group and people are encouraged to join. A particular focus is continuing the registry discussion and looking at the practical issues around harvesting ActivityStreams. The Stanford discovery meeting also raised the importance of SEO particularly with respect to JavaScript IIIF viewers. While some of this falls under 1B of the discovery charter it would also be a good topic for a general community call.  ,Version 0.1 of the discovery specification focusing on harvesting can be seen at:,http://iiif.io/api/discovery/0.1/  ,Notes on the meeting can be found in the following directory:,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jBfpPkDmK0UwDGYVXk3vjxiwlY9UR1uf",

But is there an update when access control status has changed? ,Nothing has changed - but now only people with certain IP range can see it - is that an Update? ,""Antoine - worth pointing out that the use case is addressed, rather than the more tricky case of the manifest becoming unavailable."",""Matt - get an update, get the thing, get a 403 - is it up to the client what they do?"",Rob - yes.

Plan to create a IIIF interest group to look at the user side of discovery. Focused on end users rather than specification and encourage adoption. Potential to use some novel methods like artificial intelligence. ,Does include discussions on metadata crosswalks which may be difficult but will be necessary. This new group won’t come up with its own specifications but will rely on this group. Group is open to everyone but also will target institutions that have shown interest. Each participating institution will need to contribute expertise and hopefully some collections and systems resource. Stanford are willing to fund one meeting a year and one staff coordinator. ,""The document is ready for distribution, please feedback soon if you have comments. "",TSG Chairs suggested that metadata profiles was something that could be transferred from the technical group to the community group. ,In the past we have had informal meetings to discuss the use cases for presentation api. This was less technical and discussion was focused on use cases rather than the technical implementation. This community group can provide this function. Added with the Stanford funding this should accelerate the process. We do need good collaboration between the two groups to ensure issues are passed back and forth to be discussed in the most relevant group.  ,""How many people would be interested in joining from this group? Or sending colleagues. Dave from NGA could suggest a couple of people. Richard Higgins, Regis Robineau and Julien Raemy would be interested in participating. "",Question are we targeted the correct people? Particularly metadata specialists. A good point and something the community group needs to tackle. Some of the organisations on the inital seed list are from those areas. ,""We (discovery chairs and Tom) can talk offline to discuss how the groups keep in contact, possible with joint calls. "",28: ACTION Rob to write up a 2.1 with the changed @context so we can see what it looks like.,Not been able to dedicate time to this in the last two weeks.,41: need Richard's approval for marking as duplicate	,Now resolved as a duplicate. ,46: discussion needs to continue and be escalated to other groups. Rob's proposal,""This is wider than just discovery, its more related to migration between IIIF presentation 2 and 3. Rob’s proposal suggests different URIs for the different versions which is different to the current suggested advice for migration. Current proposal which handles both cases:"",http://example.com/manifest.json,Content negotiation would forward it to either:,http://example.com/v1/manifest.json ,http://example.com/v2/manifest.json,These second links are the ones you would use in discovery to be able to show which version of the manifest changed. Rob doesn’t think we can mandate the use of this to say that updates to all versions must be shared but if you want to share updates then this is the way to do it. In Edinburgh we discussed the migration case being a recipe. If we propose the above solution it should work for both cases.  ,47: discussion needs to continue.,""What event do we show if an item’s permission or access restriction changes? We could warn the harvesters that not all resources will be accessible, maybe due to server down or change in permissions. Another possibility is to come up with a new activity but would this useful? What would we do with the information practically?  "",""Getty and Digitarti have had to take down content before. Glen, at the NLW we would also send a delete request to take it down from the aggregator too. IIIF Auth spec doesn’t currently support auth on manifests. Is this ruled out of scope until Auth supports it. Suggestion is to put a note in the spec to say resources may become unavailable and it's up to the aggregator to check.

pushed change to the repo https://preview.iiif.io/api/discovery-0.3/api/discovery/0.3,Closes most of the open Issues,Issue 47 -  what happens in AS when restrictions are added to an item?,Add a note about this potential but do not integrate anything in the the API or model,Issue 46 - Content negotiation Manifests (v2 vs. v3) what happens to AS?,Be explicit about what version is changing,Matt: are we expecting the harvester to know what that two Activities refer to the same thing?,There is not right now - but we could add a canonical URI,Glen: does the 2 URI pattern (v2 and v3) have ramifications outside of Discovery,It should not but we would want to make sure the cookbooks are in line with it	,Matt: Made Issue 48 to account the the canonical URI,Jason: “Ignore this if I'm just behind: If I'm understanding correctly one scenario which might come up is that a v2 manifest with seeAlso metadata may become static once we have reached the tipping point of v3 adoption. So at that point going forward only the v3 manifest and seeAlso metadata will get updated. So seeAlso not quite enough to ensure that they're the same.”,Canonical URI should solve that as well,Issue 45 - Use AS context as a separate,Close because we have larger issues,This is not for the Web at large but rather for people interested specifically in IIIF AS data,Issue 42 - how to connect Activity Stream Collections to other Activity Stream Collections,Create our own context that accounts for partOf,https://iiif.io/api/discovery/0/context.json,Issue 38 - move from context to seeAlso now that we have decided to have a new discovery context. No questions multiple +1s in chat. ,Issue 36 -  Do Activity Streams need descriptive properties,leave it alone and it falls into a feature model,It works the same way at the Annotation ins Prezi3,Issue 34 - a way to say how the different AS relate to each other. Is it institutional level or just a collection? Partof gives the structural relationships and this could solve this issue too. Agreed to close,Issue 28 - formalize the decision to have a seperate discovery context and mention it in the spec. https://preview.iiif.io/api/discovery-0.3/api/discovery/0.3/#341-context. Propose to close now we do discuss it in the spec. Jason notes it is good to have an extension mechanism noted from the beginning. No objects raised. ,A large number of issues have been closed now with the change to a specific discovery context. ,Content state examples,Richard (from Durham) has taken the pattern mentioned and customised their version of Mirador 2 which takes base64 encoded data and opens it in the viewer. Third example is from the Bodleian. Also added a bit of text to the annotation to say why you’ve linked it. Richard also has a tool that generates these annotations:,http://fautedemieux.net/DULIIIFimager.html?2=https://iiif.durham.ac.uk/manifests/trifle/32150/t2/mx/d0/t2mxd07gs713/manifest, Image cropper can be used to get the linking annotation ,Was there anything missing from the spec? ,Not great trouble adding it to Mirador but its tacked on as Mirador2 has stopped development.  ,Example annotation above. Resource is a text description of the link. ,Viewer zooms into the region of the image but the box helps to show what is being linked to. ,Some discussion on whether base64 is mandatory. ,Currently looking at only linking to a particular page may wait until Mirador 3 before doing further work. As this was a specific use case requirement. ,Example from Jason:,Congratulations to Richard and Olli this is a great demonstration. ,Last call we reviewed the 0.3 update. Do the protocols included in the spec match all of the use cases? ,Back to issue 22,Call to get updated list of implementations in time for the Gottingen conference. Include Toronto in this to get theres updated. ,Next meeting,""Content state then move on to notifications. Or should we go straight to notifications?

Following the call we asked them to contribute a use case to the group, so we can record what they want to do, and ensure the specs meet some parts of the case at least. A use case for notification about simplifying annotations about iiif resource being created, then flagged to a mailbox that sends around notifications. It is quite complete - doesn't go very far into the patterns they've used, but there is all the references. Only question about what Patrick has written is about authentication. There's a point at the beginning where they talk about auth'd sources, and not sure if that is in general or not. Didn't see it later on in the text. Will ask Patrick about that. FIrst is to decide if it's entirely or partly in scope."",Rob: it's about Presentation API resources and use Activity Streams and LDN. It seems in scope,""Antoine: there could be an objection, based on the fact that these notifications are about annotations that will not necessarily be included in Presentation API manifests, as published by the publishers of the IIIF resource.

Also considering that in the IIIF community we've got institutions onboard, but we also need to care for researchers."",Antoine: should we worry about authentication?,Rob: no :) We shouldn't roll our own auth spec.

Rob talk through a couple slides (and make them),Recipe group Tuesday afternoon for content state,Thursday dedicated session before lunch,Content state,This has now been merged and is available at: ,https://iiif.io/api/content-state/0.2/,https://github.com/IIIF/api/pull/1790,Still drafty but ready for testing. ,On Monday Rob did some work on discovery on a 0.4 branch. This is deployed to:,https://preview.iiif.io/api/discovery-04/api/discovery/0.4/,And the pull request linking to the issues resolved is available at:,https://github.com/IIIF/api/pull/1879 ,Note as this is a new version the diff in the branch will show a new file. One change to highlight is the context version number in the URL. After discussion with the editors it was decided to use version 1 from the start rather than 0. We came across problems with Auth as people had already started implementing and then it was difficult to change to version 1. Example change from:,.../0/context.json,To,.../1/context.json,How do people feel about this change? Jeff who has implemented feels its fine as its a minor change. Glen agrees its good to fix this now rather than see version 0 being implemented and then being difficult to change. ,https://github.com/IIIF/discovery/issues/52 - highlight in the introduction that harvester has to process the data backwards. ,https://github.com/IIIF/discovery/issues/49 - change must to should but noted URIs should not be re-used. ,""Move as an activity -  couldn’t find issue but there was a request to use move so you don’t have to rely on add then delete activity. Jeff has been struggling to implement move changes specifically to find out if and how things have moved. The use case is still valid but detecting this is difficult. This is probably more of a future proof feature rather than a core one. It may be difficult to do this automatically but in other systems likes Rob’s system the load balance would know the old and new name for an item that had been renamed. Another use case if you changed domain names e.g. data.getty.edu to iiif.getty.edu, it would be relatively easy to generate the move activities. Keep this in or take it out? Support for keeping it in for now maybe until 0.9 and see if its implemented. We should have an issue for this… We do its at: https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-stories/issues/110 but maybe it should be in the discovery repo. Rob creating an issue for it: https://github.com/IIIF/discovery/issues/58. Europeana would like to handle this well but its not always possible to link the two different URIs. "",Please look over 0.4 over the next few days and raise issues on slack or github.  Can we deploy 0.4 to master branch? We should get some reviews before merging. Antione can go through the linked issues to see if he agrees they can now be closed. Rob will add a quick summary to each issue to say what changes he made. Antoine has also found the following which shows the difference between the two versions:,https://services.w3.org/htmldiff?doc1=https%3A%2F%2Fiiif.io%2Fapi%2Fdiscovery%2F0.3%2F&doc2=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.iiif.io%2Fapi%2Fdiscovery-04%2Fapi%2Fdiscovery%2F0.4%2F,Moving on to issues to discuss which were flagged need Jeff for:,https://github.com/IIIF/discovery/issues/54,Use case is if a user marks a collection as hidden or deleted it what should happen? Jeff has DCAT and other metadata about these collections. Question is what should we do with the collection and the linked dataset. Its a regular action to make a collection hidden while they work on it then make it public again. The issues with the dataset being left public is that people may still harvest this. It would seem to make sense that if the collection is deleted then the metadata dataset should also be deleted. These would then return 404s. Example if you created a manifest then did a couple of edits before deleting you would still see the events in the activity stream. Could add an implementation note to highlight if an item was deleted the URIs are probably no longer relevant.    , ,""Wider question what should a company like OCLC / Content DM do if an institution leaves Content DM. Should it send a deletion event for each item, should it remove the stream itself to be replaced by a 404. This seems more of a notification use case. If you sent a notification that the stream was deleted to clients they would be better placed to handle this. "",Could you put this in your terms and conditions to say streams may disappear. ,Notification workflow: ,Client leaves,Notification sent to `iiif  master registry` to say the stream has been deleted. ,Maybe 410 Gone would be a better response rather than 404. ,https://github.com/IIIF/discovery/issues/48,We don’t really have the use case from the annotation spec. It might help with the content negotiation question. This might help with the presentation API if you are able to say this is the conical version and you can negotiate which version you want. Its difficult to know without examples so maybe we should try this. ,https://github.com/IIIF/discovery/issues/43,We can discuss in Ann Arbor so can undefer this issue. ,Safe url encoding of the base64 content state content was raised a few meetings ago. Is this going to be base64url conforming to RFC 4648 section 5? https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5,Richard can you create this as an issue in GitHub and it would be good to discuss this in Ann Arbor.",

Consensus seemed to be to not add this to the spec but to show how to handle this in a recipe. ,Use case is I want to create a registry which is specific or a subset of the global registry e.g. dinosaur fossils.

Or just a note in the discovery spec to say its fine to have overlapping streams and harvesters should prepare to see the same event in multiple streams. ,This was part of the discussion. It seems these implementation notes has moved away from the spec into recipes. Yes this has generally gone into recipes.

For 82 - Glen to create an example that the group can look at and then a recipe issue can be created.  ,Should the IIIF registry accept activity streams with any non-IIIF resources? Activist Streams should primarily contain IIIF resources.    ,This could also resolve the following if you can allow different objects in the stream:,https://github.com/IIIF/discovery/issues/63 ,Crawler doesn't know when to stop reading activities,You could put a marker in the stream to say refreshed at this point so no need to go further. Adding a timestamp means you have to edit the top level collection and it doesn’t feel like a top level property. Can you remove streams? ,If a provider did a complete refresh and removed past activity streams. This would leave a consumer unsure if an object was deleted as the record of the delete would be missing. Also an issue if you were to re-use an identifier if an object was deleted this would cause issues. We may need to say something in the spec regarding this. ,An activity in the stream for a refresh event wouldn’t be helpful for a regular harvester as they need to know about delete events. A new harvester would find this event useful as it could harvest from this point.  ,We could make a recommendation that before doing a hard refresh it should include deletes. Should we create a summary of resource events? Probably not as the first refresh event would be the one you want. ,Is this becoming similar to a resource sync bootstrap? Maybe we could put a potential link to a resource dump into the refresh event. Potentially we fence post the refresh event i.e. this is the initial state of the content with an event at the start and the end. This could be a create event with the id being the dump. One issue will be you need some way of mapping URIs from the Activity Stream into the dump file. How do we proceed? We could create a note and ask for comments as this could be a 1.1 change.",

While the client will likely have to dereference it at some point, a library that produces some internal representation to drive the client might result in both that library and the main client doing the dereference.

Not so lovely. The “open this manifest” activity is probably the most common one. But we do need to support the full annotation by reference for the reason given before.,Tom: people are used to existing systems that you pass a manifest URL to.,Glen: could we use a different parameter?,""Tom: could, but don’t like it."",Glen: given that most implementations just handled manifest URIs are we breaking anything if we add a different parameter?,""Rob: the simple URI form, which doesn’t require encoding, is attractive and shouldn’t get rid of it.

Is dereferenceability such a big issue anyway?,Glen: multiple dereferences only happen in the “wrapper” case.,""Rob: of the options on the table the status quo might be the best option.

Glen and I have talked about guidelines, but we don't have a way for someone to contribute now."",… Ed has one path for UV contributions.
