Need something concrete to show for it. (a JSON schema is not enough),Thinking about applications per institution or community? Both. Doesn’t have to be an application with 15 institutions. But want to have some collaboration and extensibility.,It has to be structured search to show the power of these techniques. THe first question we will get is “is that just a big keyword search” and it will be on us to show the real benefit ,Is there is a difference between making an application with our data sets and a machine readable query point….e.g. SPARQL endpoint? ,SPARQL endpoints lose interest. ,IIIF viewers tend to only show one data set. Just a pretty zooming image. Mirador only example of really blending collections. Searching across collections is really useful but we could build an app with less investment sooner.

"",We should recognize how radically different an event-based model is how institutions traditionally treat objects. The lifecycle and chain of events is interesting.,""Paper doll app, scale to arrange an exhibition. COuld be used to help create loan exhibitions. Look at use cases outside of this room. A wall label generator across institutions. We should make little tools that make museum staff lives easier."",Target management with dog and pony show. (and peers as well).,There is value in going to management and saying an aggregator is consuming our datasets because we are using this model. Dog and pony show examples are not answering research questions and have limited usefulness.,""Making the development of the tools quicker and easier, cost is lowered when standards are adopted. "",Presentation to the board is examples of things have down,Tour ML once structure is there you can make audio tours ,Maybe reconciliation is needed to show it works. ,This could be a case for resourcing. Use business cases to show where we are saving time. ,""The consistency of vocabulary terms, if we are all using our local vocabs the success is much lower"",""What’s the recommended way to reconcile. If you use a local thesaurus uri, want to have a way to reconcile. E.g. if you are not using AAT in systems. "",What’s the crossover with Wikimedia community? AAC has been pushed into Wikidata. There is volunteer effort there and a community with its own norms and standards (and would take work to interface with that).,Sum of All Paintings - is one of the projects that is that organized. Most areas in Wikipedia are not that regularized.,""Wikidata is one aspect, but less machine-intensive things but just like making tools to create wall labels, we could make it easier for Wikipedians to use our collections"",Linked.Art Wikimedian?,Smithsonian has experience hiring a Wikimedian and could provide some expertise. It’s a cultural realm to navigate.,Upper levels of management is sincerely interested in engaging with this question of how to incorporate these sorts of datasets.,Wikidata already has a place for linked IDs so we could make use of it. To show a use case without having to reconcile everything. Could help if we are concerned about reconciling data. ,Wikimedia could be one of the partners. ,Wikidata wants to be the wikipedia of data which is not necessarily what our institutions want,Afternoon: Object Model,""Depiction, concept, style and the rest of the murkiness"",""YCBA - Tend to skirt issue by only tagging depicted. But sometimes also tag associated people (e.g. Shakespeare) , allegory."",Case of a association (e.g. dog of artist). V&A has content Other for that case.,How are we distinguishing between what is depicted and what is the subject? We don’t have to overlap what is covered in subject with what is depicted. But should state this explicitly.,Aboutness: ,Subject: interpretation,Depiction: identification,Description: description,Do we need to create a test? Should we bring the test back to our institutions? See how each institution would apply these Aboutness terms.

Give people the baseline to understand the showcase (e.g. artworks to depict place and people)"",SN: Add’l framework for showcase would be research questions (as Lynn has mentioned on previous calls) Anything to highlight about depiction?,LR: MoMA exhibition and depiction of artwork; movement of works; it’s extremely tedious work by hand to uncover this information but it is very useful for scholars; would be compelling; step in between scholarly question and the data,AS: We may not be able to answer interesting scholarly questions right away; we aim to “get the busywork out of the way”; but we show how to approach these questions and the info can be readily available ,Depictions get at finding ways to make connections (without heavy work); especially bc GOK about ideas and network of people that is of interest to researchers,We’re not sure if AI can be used to answer interesting high-level questions; but we can show how the clerical work can be taken care of (and tedious work is out of the way); this should be attractive,MoMA exhibition example is easy to understand and makes the case for how we can work on this,MoMA Showcase Example,Sami: can work with this ,""Out of this meeting, we want concrete action items and know who is doing what (e.g. screenshots, etc)"",Sami: We might not necessarily need a mockup that demonstrates relationship between data,""Priority: depiction, timeline, exhibition example?"",Rob: leave out exhibition for this upcoming showcase; bc would want to have worked through how to model artworks; wouldn’t be advisable to model aspects we have not worked out yet,Want to model what we are prepared to answer: Depiction and Timeline would be ready for discussion,Shift in mentality from the object to the activity is important; timeline would be able to show this,""Sami: Depictions could still include exhibition photography or exhibitions as events, without needing to model how we model exhibitions"",""Kevin: Suitability and expressiveness of the model; why should people to use the same model (this may be obvious in a way but would be worthwhile to show), avoiding repetition is a good thing to point out; in terms of any higher level framings, we should at least aim to make people aware of these areas; "",Adam: should demonstrate how we fill in each other's gaps; collaborate and move each other forward; ,""Lynn: could make a blurb for showcases; Depiction isn’t interesting in itself, but when it’s networked and you can see it as at a bigger picture"",Kevin: could we see depiction is a necessary layer/precursor to bigger questions; we can point out procedural/operational win of avoiding repetition (ie. redundant efforts),Duane: Curators interested in timelines when they are looking at influence (Who knew who/what when); influence of movement over time; Distribution (Charlie did this with AAC data) to show how holdings are distributed,""Rob: Distribution when information is distributed e.g. GOK artworks depicted in photographs; Getty does not have information and can’t generate it from image; but based on color, time, materials, styles, etc… you can gain this information. Can partition information by time as well as location"",Rob: may not be intellectually interesting but is a necessary step to get to bigger questions,Kevin: need to be wary of promises of great scholarship and visualizations (should be good and compelling but show benefit of technology is the ability to make visualizations and make scholarship through shared collation of data),Adam: not sure we need to convince people that computers can answer complex questions and bringing high-level q’s to automation level; but do want to show it can get grunt work out of the way to get to that point,Do we want to set up the utility of the model?

POV"",Rob: [corrects graph on whiteboard],""Kevin: I'm thinking of the API, not graph traversal."",Kevin: these two models certainly do overlap in domain,George: there are many different types of events that can be triggered with action in an auction,Rob: what is the relationship between acquisition and the auction? is it a matter of purpose?,George: only if the auction was specifically meant for the purpose of buying back the offered items,""Rob: it is a """"triggers"""" relationship"",""Lynn: what is the timespan of the auction? maybe the auction is three days, but different specific items are sold on each day"",Rob: the timespan would be three days but different events would be triggered on each day,George: you haven't made the actual time of purchase available to link to,""George: ok """"triggers"""" is good."",Lynn: who is carrying out these activities?,Rob: [names several parties as examples],Ethan: how about bibliographic references?,Rob: let's add an auction catalog to our example,""Rob: it has parts, which are the entries"",Rob: catalogs [are abstract and] can be carried by physical carriers,""Rob: when there isn't a sale, you still want to know what objects are being auctioned"",""John: isn't that a """"no sale"""" event?"",""Rob: nope, no change of ownership occurred so no event is triggered at all"",George: suggests P16,Set vs Curated Holding,George: I think the lot is offered in the three objects [that comprise it],""Rob: does the lot identifier id the activity, the objects in the lot, or what?"",George: is there more to the lot than its items?,George: can you buy part of  a lot?,""Lynn: If they aren't sold altogether, it's not selling that lot, it's selling something else"",""George: you're bidding on the whole, not the parts"",Lynn: sometimes buyers coordinate to cover a lot,Lynn: how about when the auctioneer loses a piece?,George: an auction item is definitely being curated in a collection. ,""Ethan: then you can have one acquisition event for four items, which is much better than having one per one"",""Thanasis: the definition of """"curation"""" that it used in CRM comes from geology and may not be valid here"",""George: we only mean by """"curated holding"""" to avoid really unplanned groupings"",David: it's purposeful,George: yes,""Nicola: """"according to a particular collection development plan"""" is the wording in use"",""Edward: if individual lots can be curated sets of objects, then auctions - selling thematically - can comprise of curated sets of lots"",Lynn: it's a informed decision what you do and don't put in a lot,George: I think this is CRM-kosher,George: this problem occurs elsewhere in modeling,[agreement that Thanasis is on the hook to propose many changes to CRM],Rob: can you auction conceptual things?,Rob: there are extreme examples (Banksy),Nicola: but what did you really sell? the rights?,Rob: which are not a curated holding,George: do we have that case?,""Rob: should that be considered to be in scope we cannot use the class we should like because of this """"curated holding"""" business"",Rob: if auctioning conceptual art is in or out of scope decides what part of CRM we must use,George: I think that Thanasis should propose E78 should be broadened to be less focused on musicology,Rob: [noodles on whiteboard],""John: generally you will come from the object when you look at this, you aren't starting with the auction"",Rob: either way you need to connect the two,John: so the object becomes part of the lot?,Rob: yes. the auction lot contents may never actually be brought together. custody isn't needed to auction something off ,""Lynn: I went to an auction where an item was an experience, which is certainly not a physical object"",Lynn: you are buying a performance,Rob: I buy tickets for performances at auction,""David: you can bid on a commissioned work, which is really bidding on a promise"",George: we need a conceptual object that groups things by contingent enumeration,George: thinking about a lot as a thing with four parts is bizarre,Thanasis: we consider them together because they are a lot,Rob: is my Amazon shopping basket an extended E78?,Nicola: what does physical propinquity even mean in a digital library?,""Thanasis: if your collection is actually of dealers, you may wish to consider them as physical things"",Nicola: the problem of conceptual art remains,George: this is an issue for the SIG,""Rob: regardless of the conceptual art question, we would like to broaden E78"",""George: either we broaden E78 to be any things you put together on purpose, or we consider things in proximity to join into a new thing, or we get a new """"Set"""" concept to hold these things"",George: [gives an arbitrary list as example],Nicola: the problem is that list doesn't exist,George: it does because I just made it,Rob: we will take this up with the SIG,Rob: of course we can mint our own class for this,George: would you please send us some samples of this for us to show the SIG?,[agreement],Rob: here's yet fresh hell,Rob: an auction catalog has three things as a lot,Rob: but the auction never takes place,Rob: so there is no connection back to the catalog,Rob: which connections would we like to add?,""Thanasis: The catalog lists the lots, not the events"",""Edward: is there a moment when the item is """"offered""""?"",Thanasis: and there are auctions with no catalogs,Lynn: sometimes people just write these things down ,John: or maybe something is referred to in a  catalog that isn't for sale,Rob: we can make that link,Rob: symmetry is easier to explain than asymmetry,""Rob: we've covered sold, unsold-but-offered, withdrawn, offered but bought back by the auction house"",Rob: when the lot goes out of existence depends on whether it is a physical object,Thanasis: it goes away when any of the contents go away,George: the notion of E78 is that we aren't precise about its contents. small changes to them don't change the identity of an E78,""George: a lot is more of a conceptual object, and a conceptual object never goes away"",""Lynn: when the lot isn't sold and the set is disbanded, it is gone"",Rob: but the conceptual idea of the set remains,George: otherwise you would have to destroy some physical thing,""Rob:  if a lot is a physical thing, how does it go out of existence?"",Subtopic: Auctions/Prices,[several kinds of prices are enumerated] ,Lynn: and commission price,""Rob: the offered price is easy, it's written in the catalog"",Rob: the final price is easy,Rob: the reserve price is more complicated,Rob: it is neither described nor paid,""David: the reserve price is on the lot, not the contents"",""Rob: could it be a dimension of type """"reserve price"""" with a currency and amount?"",""George: that would work quite well if a lot were a conceptual object, because you wouldn't have to manage change"",Rob: the reserve price is the least possible price they will accept,David: how is the price paid determined for each item in the lot?,Rob: it isn't [yet]. that's why we want to ramify the model further,George: you could use attribute assignment to qualify valuations ,Edward: does the reserve price get associated with sets only in that context?,Edward: just in auctions?,Lynn: it pops up in consignment as well,""Edwin: Ok, so it's reusable"",Rob: those are the prices we [the Getty] commonly have,""Lynn: when museums deaccession something, they might set a reserve price"",""George: you would need to specify in a query that you want to know what an event cost someone, you will need to aggregate"",Rob: the other effect of not being able to partition dimensions is that you cannot use multiple units in a dimension. this stinks.,Thanasis: that is an ongoing issue,""John: what about when the auction house guarantees a price, and if the item doesn't sell, it will buy the item from the owner for that price"",""John: it's the same idea, but a different name is used"",Rob: nice one,""John: an estimate has two values, low and high. how do we model that?"",Rob: P90a and P90b?,Rob: until April we would have been stuffed,Rob: but now we have P90a and b to handle that,Rob: But we would need to propose splitting the property hierarchy further because we are using subproperties of P90 now,""Edward: can we not call the reserve price simply """"the price""""?"",Edward: or is that just a label?,Rob: it is a value chosen from some vocabulary (e.g. AAT) ,John: in the catalog there may be an estimated range of what things will go for?,""John: it is referred to in the entry. It's not a guess, we are recording something from the catalog"",Thanasis: but it's not a price at sale,""Rob: there is no uncertainty about the values, they are bounds"",Thanasis: then the CRM property in use P90 is wrong,Rob: I agree,Rob: we will break the estimate apart into two values,Karina: I can find examples where there is but one number,David: is there a place to record bidding increment?,Rob: that seems like a step too far to me,David: so no record of the course of bidding?,Kevin: that sounds like the job of the auction house to publish that,Ethan: how about a currency for which there is no AAT URI?,""Rob: mint your own, or ask AAT for a new one"",Topic: Agenda for next day,* Check in on process,Rob: How do we feel about everything?,Chris:  More often use examples for the calls to illustrate and motivate the discussions,Dave: Decide how to get to implementations quickly and further refine the model as necessary,Kevin: In terms of timetable… are we okay?,Dave: How do we know when we're done to v1.0?,Rob: Some hindrances with ,Lynn: Could have had smaller groups breaking out,Sami: Breakout group for API?,Kevin: Extra time for breakout groups?,Sami: we need to get more work done ahead of time. this was beneficial because Rob came with concrete proposals,""Emanuelle: smaller and shorter breakout sessions, interleaving modeling and other discussions"",Rob: my concern with breaking up groups is that people will self-select into areas where they feel expert,Rob: but a lot of value comes from people requiring explanation,Rob: we might lose the value of diverse participation,Chris: then we might need to make sure the agenda shows that,Lynn and Rob: we might need a coordinating committee,Sami: just getting the sample datasets was all the participation some people needed,Lynn: if we know about the event earlier,""Rob: you who favor breaking out, what would the proposal be?"",Rob: I suspect that everyone would want to be part of every breakout,Kevin: allocating calls to specific topics flags [the conversation] enough,""Sami: how are you feeling, Rob?"",Rob: now I have two co-chairs. I am happy because of that.,Sami: if we start figuring out how best to share examples?,Edward: GitHub issue?,Ethan: I find Slack quite useful for proposing ideas or working through a modeling issue.,Nicola: GitHub is useful for this exchange,Kevin: is it work trying tomorrow to slot topics into our future calls?,""Thanasis: There seems to be a timeline for things to happen, which doesn't match with the CRM SIG timelines. Decisions at SIG level might be made a year from now. I worry about the risk of making decisions too quickly and misaligning L.A from the CRM."",""Thanasis: also, discussions are being repeated. it can become difficult to sustain multiple discussions via travel. If we aligned better with the SIG meetings, we could bring issues to discussion there more efficiently."",Rob: we could do better at raising issues for the SIG when they come up for us,George: we made an issue in the SIG about creating the corridor. there are other groups with schedule mismatches with the SIG. The SIG is not indifferent. We need a better procedure.,""Rob: let's take """"Set"""" as an example. What's the procedure?"",""Rob: there is no construct for what we want. we need a new class. we should ask the SIG to do this, give them some time to discuss, and if that doesn't match our timelines, we can create an extension."",""Rob: if/when that extension is taken over by the SIG, the L.D API wouldn't change because we absorb the change in the JSON-LD context"",George: I want a formal procedure with tickets.

Lynn: Wins auction but does not own the object. Buys on behalf of someone else. Rob: and might never have custody especially if object never moves. Lynn: Example of house shows proxy does not have custody. Object never moves. Thanasis: Any paperwork when owner wins auction? Lynn: Depends on documentation. Do record prices and who bid, but do not record ownership. Emmanuelle: Also owners wish to remain anonymous. Thanasis: If there isn’t documentation of sale then just record bidding. Rob: As part of auction of the lot, there is the activity of the act of bidding carried by the agent acting on behalf of the owner. How do we know about non successful bids. Kevin: Only record what we know, how do we deal with the question of what is inferred? Are any of the statements described by Rob sufficient to describe the action? Results in an indirect way of description. Rob: Highest bid with a reserve price is important for art market research. Dave: If winner doesn’t pay the agreed price. Kevin: Failed auction?”. Thanasis: Contract? Rob: We know a bid amount but no transfer of ownership. Flexible way to describe auctions? Bids in auction not part of the transfer. Thanasis: Bidding one activity, transfer of custody is another. Kevin: Only way to get to transfer is inference. Thanasis: Only way to find the declaration of transfer, the inference is the winning bid. Rob: Could have the winning bid trigger the transfer of the object. Lynn: Often we do not know. We know it was auction but do not know if sold or if there was an acquisition. Later data shows a new owner but not that it was acquired at the auction. Kevin: We have not enumerated all of the states of the model. Lynn: if we know other bids, they record underbidder for auctions. Should these be recorded?

This is a type of categorization relevant to a context.,Joe: do you care about context? The thing is exemplary relevant to some context.,""George: Could use attribute assignment. Seems like a common practice so we should be able to capture it. If you have a relationship and add a property on top, people will use that for everything. Context is very interesting, such as for an exhibition.  Going through an Attribute Assignment lets you contextualize using existing machinery in the model. Basic structure would be to use assigned / assigned_to, with AA node in the middle. Still wouldn't have a property for X being exemplary for Y -- this can be the type, exemplary-ness.  Then have actors and time and so on."",Joe: if we have the notion of assigning a set of things to the object as being exemplary… then should we consider order?,Rob: we try to avoid rdf:list.

However, Attribute Assignment may be a nicer way of doing this. Both patterns are very, very similar; so if we could use generic AAs then we wouldn’t have to make a relationship class. Meaning one less thing to maintain."",""In relation to the model example for student-teacher-school. Attribute Assignement, used here:"",```turtle,<teacher> assigned_to_by AttribAssignment,AttribAssignment assigns <student> ;,  P177_assigned_property_type <teacher-of> .,```,George: doing something like the AA pattern in order to express arbitrary things (x is related to y) as random relationship... this seems like a better pattern. But I wouldn’t make it recommended. Plus one to current suggestion.,""Joe: would you want to twin this with a vocabulary of relationships? For Linked.Art, do we centralise an agreed list of types?"",""Antoine: there’s always a need to find a pertinent vocabulary, which is a wider problem than the specific implementation being discussed."",Rob: how to express sufficient usability balanced with sufficient interoperability?

The Attribute Assignment is often used to indicate that somebody has an opinion about something. In a way, I do not see the student as an attribute that the teacher receives.

One of the reasons we didn’t want to handle social relations is to avoid biting off more than we can chew in terms of the ontology.,Thanasis: is the problem that the CRM soc haven’t formalised the relationship properties? It’s a matter of time before Linked Art accepts their resolution. We don’t want to make a decision here beforehand.,""Joe: as an alternative, one of the ways this could be done is make the person a member of a group. Then define the relationships in the definition of the group. Also not perfect."",Rob: Getty has done this too. It works OK for people and roles. E.g. the PM of New Zealand is a Group which only ever has one member. But issues arise when we’re not talking about a person or set of people. And directionality is tricky too. Which essentially just moves the problem. Having something consistent with representative objects would be good as it would be consistent. So we want a relatively-straightforward-and-not-wrong way to express this.,Rob: ,```turtle,Conceptual Object assigned_to_by AttribAssign,Assign assigns Type ( number ),```,Does this seem semantically incorrect? Compare this purely mathematical example to the specific sibling example?,George: if you knew the direct relationship then you would use an existing component of the ontology. This has to support cases where it’s not known.,Thanasis: how soon does this need to be implemented? Would it be better to sort this is CRM SOC beforehand?,Joe: you could have relationships between two E1s. That’s the level of the generic problem.,Thanasis: I don’t think so; I think it’s within the bounds of social interaction.,George: hasn’t the problem opened up more broadly? Student-teacher is just an example. But also… the moon is related to the sun… through galaxy… things.,Rob: where we have these statements we want to use them.,Joe: any use of this data must have strict processing rules so that properties aren’t creeping into inferences for other relations.,""Thanasis: if we want to express a relationship between any two things, how valuable is allowing searching on it? Maybe we do not support such a thing with tooling."",""Rob: yes, search could become terribly complicated or unreliable."",""Joe: this type of relationship is important to hold on to, but how should it be re-used. There’s a difference between data being held in limbo pending being modelled and it remaining so for use."",""Rob: regardless of all the other problems, the September proposal seems worse than Attribute Assignment. However AA has exactly the same set of problems with the exception that it will already be understood by CRM community members. Therefore, let’s work with SOC to explore the bonds issue. Because if there is a better pattern coming from bonds it would be better to avoid having two patterns."",Ryan: bye,""Rob: would prefer, however, to have something written down for this pending resolution at the end of the calendar year. This at least improves the situation."",""Thanasis: it might be unclear, in this model, what is assigned to what. How do you decide which side the thing goes? Do we really have such a burning need for this? In terms of peoples’ real data do we need this in v1?"",""Rob: good question. We could be silent on it. Probably every CMS has examples of HMOs with related_object, which is similar. Both related- and representative-objects seem pretty ubiquitous. So would prefer to have something in v1, yes."",Thanasis: OK,Antoine: agree. It matches better the DCAT qualified relationship pattern. Still a bit luke warm about Attribute Assignment as it may encourage people to put provenance data here. But if that provenance is optional it's fine!,""Joe: we need several worked examples to ensure that the directionality works. You may always require pairs of AAs, because both things have a relationship. This is messy but captures the duality."",Antoine: the other pattern supported from and to.,Issue 219,(Dimensions of arrangement),Rob: Getty CMS has dimension with types which simply describe those dimensions at the time that the dimensions were taken. State does complicate things significantly in that it is an ongoing thing in an ontology that is configured around changes in state.,""Rob: is there something we want to try to work on, or defer? Do we want to tackle this?"",""Joe: is this a class question or a type question? Class would complicate the ontology, with an infinite number of instances of the state of the object. Making vocabulary controlled hierarchies of types is maybe a simple solution."",Object has dimension. Dimension has type width. Width has type width with lid open.,It’s a bunch of types either way you do it! At scale it might be a lot simpler to string together a lot of different dimensions than model all the events which invoke state changes in the object.,Rob: what about a polyhierarchy of the terminology: dimension terms and state terms?,""George: use technique and procedure and say that measuring in one state or another is not a function of the object. Rather that we used to open-map style of measuring. Object went through a measurement event. We would need a sensible vocabulary to describe these measuring procedures.

Got to come up with a method to make setting the agenda more transparent. Commenting on issues is an indication of people being interested in them. This could be a way to set the agenda, i.e. start with issues with comments and if none is commented then move on to other. Interaction with the issue in the form of “thumbs-up” clicks is enough."",Agreed: To prioritise the commented issues for the agenda.,RS: Good idea for issue raiser to chair the part of the meeting that discusses the issue.,AV: Same practice in CRM-SIG and it works,JP: Also useful to ensure that the raiser has understood the resolution. Also an issue assignment method would be useful.,""RS: People should have access to “assign” tools if they have a GitHub account. If they are not included in the LA repo, then Rob can add them."",Agreed: That the issue raiser can chair the bit of the meeting related to the issue.,RS: The questionnaire is useful to ensure that everyone gets the chance to contribute. ,JP: Consider a separate call only on modelling with worked examples to share experience with other people. This is to address the concerns about lack of time given that the regular meetings are only an hour. A bit of modelling surgery setup,""Edward: A tag/label may be useful for an issue, so that an issue itself can be about a specific example of modeling a set of data."",Agreed: new tag on GitHub “mapping” for issues about specific datasets,""	I have mentioned this before, but I have been working on a system to visualise mapping examples: https://jpadfield.github.io/cidoc-crm.examples/ In the example it is cidoc stuff but it could be used - simple text automatically converted into interactive web models. (JP) Might even just be nice to share agreed example models, if not for discussion."",""Kevin: London we put an open call out for people attending the workshop, beyond the people on the calls, to bring their favorite example and a difficult one.  Then this group helped in breakout groups to try and see how linked art fitted modeling the data. Worked well, but a step away from more validation task of working with real data from systems. The timely point of the AHRC grant will have a call for the wider community to suggest use cases with the aim to work up to detailed exemplars. One question is how to continue that in lockdown, as original plan was for a face to face. Not sure we can directly bring them together but thinking how to do it would be useful. Different to brainstorming around a table."",""Thanasis: Asked consortium to submit examples of documentation. We curated them in advance to make sure they were useful examples. Purpose was also didactic for the participants. Divided into groups according to interests and people with more experience with CRM would explain the mapping. Some people were even convinced of the process :)  For LCD we consider changes too, haven’t worked out how to do it. Kristen has suggested a format of online seminars / tutorials where people bring their data and we spend an hour looking at the data online. But haven’t formalized that yet.  We can report back when there’s more discussions."",""George: Great if those were recorded, especially if they solve a problem. Towards a wider issue putting something together in a PhD program in Cyprus to pick up CRM. Informal dial-in radio show for semantics. Dear abby… :D [/rs]"",GB: Having visual and audio with real data and being able to follow is much more useful.,RS: Would this need to be a separate call or replace current regular calls? Possibly be a separate call as the membership may be different. At the moment two calls are not enough to cover all activity.,Kevin:  Mapping discussion where Richard  (e.g.) has data and how to map.  And then the more engaging activity to get others from outside of the group.  E.g. curation of exemplars. Two different cases (or steps to get stuck in),RS: We could usgmae the same process for the discussion but separate workflow to enter the discussion. Individual members may discuss with internal people who wish to discuss modelling and bring them in to the more topical mapping call.,KP: People in the group can discuss and deliver mappings advice to external anyway.,KW: Consider how we could keep track of specific examples to refer to in the future.,RS: Showing example of the photoarchive on the linked.art website as an example of a sample record.,JP: The specific example may be a little scary for people. Joe’s example showing visualization of triples to be shown with a direct HTML links. There is also a way to include documentation on these model-nodes. Joe built is for a specific example but we can replace the underlying data with different examples.,RS: Try to find time and example to do a more practical and model oriented call.,""Agreed: Richard to bring data for example, Edward,  Karina to flesh out use cases.

Ideal strand would be for that knowledge to intersect with an institution interested in developing LA as a technology. Richard: provenance would be doable? There are established people. Kevin: really interested in exploring that, ask your colleagues. Need to talk about provenance of a period or particular material type. Dave: Distribution of collection as to ethnicity.

Rob: that could be tricky. Dave: relationship with objects? ,""Joe: another model test, person with professional paintings and amateur paintings?"",Kevin and Joe: question of large project over time with multiple projects.

Would welcome attention and contributions relating to leadership.,Summary of last week’s mapping call:,Kevin: good call. Example from the Rijksmuseum with Rob performing live OmniGraffling which raised a few issues regarding how the API sits with the model. Same exemplar continues next week.,Joe: have been doing more work on own GitHub system which helps generate Mermaid diagrams from committed models. Would be interested in putting together config for colours and shapes for Linked Art. Currently built from a text file containing a simple set of tab separated triples. https://jpadfield.github.io/simple-modelling/ (docs being built),Rob: Edward and Rob have also been playing around with live-modelling/diagramming Python tooling (see Showcase1 repo),Model issues:,#346: membership of arbitrary sets,All the API responses should be able to have membership of a set resource. Object part of collection. Place part of travel route set. Person part of set of people (as opposed to a Group).,""However, we haven’t really talked about Sets much, and relationship with other entities."",`member_of` is already a CRM property for constituting groups; so we could re-use the term via JSON-LD mapping.,""Thanasis: re: non-physical and physical auction items discussion at Oxford - this felt a little too specific at the time, but Rob’s outline (about) summarises the use cases well. Own opinion is that the semantics need explanations as to why things have been put together."",""Rob: mixed physicality sets could be solved with their own class, but this isn’t a case where a Place would be part of the set. This might be too specific. And require reactive modelling to arising use cases."",Thanasis: appreciate that ongoing re-modelling discussions can’t happen too frequently.,""Rob: in the ontology we could note: although the range is an E1, we expect it to be used with E22s (and other entities). In theory then, you could use a Set for anything: Places with Types (which makes no sense whatsoever); but in practice people won’t do this. So don’t prohibit weirdness."",""Joe: grouping collection things arbitrarily, especially in relation to things which aren’t art objects, in CRM… a collection of use cases put forward as part of the Linked Art 3 project proposal. Modelling the collection may require modelling of other things: the people in this meeting only came from such-and-such specialty."",Rob: only a limited number of concepts in scope: these are the other API endpoints. Any of these (with the possible exception of Places?) seem like they could usefully be in a Set of entities. Restricting a composition of Places and Digital Objects seems unhelpful.,Joe: conceptual things?,Rob: it has to be a Textual thing.,Joe: how about the Set of terms which we should not use to describe our objects because they are objectionable?,Joe: subject matter and keywords are notions people will want to use.,Rob: seems like a meta-issue. It’s not describing the objects but the metadata about the objections.,""Joe: a set of types: all of these paintings relate to trees; these to water. Fire, Water, Earth relate to the elements. Keywords are often the links software needs to use to connect things."",Rob: in favour of moving forwards with this. There are good use cases for collecting a mix of concepts together in Sets. Would anyone be disappointed if we permitted any Linked Art primary entities being part of a Set?,Joe: the limitation of CIDOC was that you couldn’t combine sets of things.,Rob: CRM doesn’t support our primary use-case of physical and non-physical things.,Thanasis: we need to recognise that a property that connects anything to anything else is not particularly useful for anything deep. But it does cover our use cases very well..,Joe: possible that people will shortcut proper semantics by using Set.,Rob: so we shouldn’t use this as a stand-in for a real relationship.,""Joe: examples will help, showing both Set use and nicely-semantically-describe relations."",Thanasis: don’t want it to be a workaround for complex modelling that you want people to do.,""Kevin: some of these slightly arbitrary Sets are tending towards being out-of-scope, even though the use-cases are well founded."",""George: where does this fit into CIDOC-CRM? If it is more or less like a list, ontologically, -- ah it’s a PropositionalObject -- that’s fine, we just need a nice scope note for this. We need to be clear that you wouldn’t use it for a group of people (they have Group)."",#357: cause of death,""Rob: people can die, and that’s part of the Person record; but the cause of death is an Event."",Joe: is this only people and not other things? A Group or Organisation could die. Maybe a stretch of the definition but the process is the same. Would this follow this semantic pattern?,""Rob: same relationship applied to the dissolution of the group, or the destruction of the whatever."",?: death of a racehorse? (not getting notified of who is speaking),Rob: CRM is not good at animals. We have tended to stay away from describing living creatures who are not people.,Joe: Titian’s Death of Action (sp.)? Represents event in the painting.,Thanasis: we do have BiologicalObject in the CRM.,Rob: we can declare the cause of the destruction of objects; but we cannot give the cause of death of a person. Death() currently only has time and place.,""Joe: it’s quite common for people to want to describe what materials killed artists: lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, etc. Also see death of Robert Hayden."",Joe: can the Death occur during an event?,""Rob: following the destruction pattern - it was caused by another event. The death did not occur during the stabbing, but the stabbing caused the person to die."",""Rob: relatively easy to add cause property with range of another Event entity. The cost isn’t high, but if it’s not going to be useful then we shouldn’t do it."",Joe: unlikely for people to want to model old age as a cause of death.,Edward: relationship is just caused not caused death by?,Rob: Yes,Joe: this pattern could be used for many other things.,""Rob: yes, we use it for the Production of objects too. The Production was caused by commission. Current property is `O13`. I don’t think the cognitive cost for following this pattern is very high; there’s no added cost for understanding. There is a low cost for API and model documentation. Although we don’t have data in big collection management systems, it does seem worth the minimum cost of implementation."",Thanasis: the `caused_by` property looks to be using CRMsci. I think that triggered by applies to events which do not have agency. We should double check if we are using this for events with agency.,Joe: would this mean that a house being burned down because some lava flowed into it - would be compatible with the model; but someone pouring petrol on it and setting alight - would not.,Rob: if it works for events then it should work for activities. It doesn’t say only for use with E5s and not E7s.,Thanasis: there was discussion of this in relation to causality. Causality is hard to prove so we opted to make it more general.,Joe: we could preface all of the properties with is currently believed to…,""Thanasis: intent. Re: chaos theory. There was no intent on the actor’s behalf to cause something; nevertheless, it did happen. The intent was lacking."",Joe: modelling intent then may need additional commentary.,#355: cultural sensitivity fields,Richard: added this to discussion as aware. The very labelling of the topic itself may be a discussion being had also.,""Richard: in light of current events and awarenesses, we are going to be re-cataloguing and marking cultural sensitivity: what and why. At first this may be text, but linked from the issue is a vocabulary for making statements of this kind.."",Richard: also data relating to who would have been able to see/interact with an object.,?: At the McCord (sp?) there are objects which need to be covered at night; can only be shown during certain seasons. There is information for this in the acquisition records but not in the ontology.,Rob: there should be a set of controlled values?,""Richard: ideally yes, although we may begin with a textual statement."",""Richard: Kevin, maybe say something towards this being rolled into a future project strand?"",Joe: Tate looking at extending project funding for implementing further vocabulary detoxing.,?: what about using PROV (from W3C) to record that things were stated at a certain time; rather than continually revisiting the data and bringing into line with current culture.,""Joe: the ability to capture mixed or conflicting beliefs would be wonderful. But if there are objects which have restrictions on use, how can we make this data searchable/usable/findable to a user and not just a historian of the data."",""Kevin: we have proposed to AHRC to look at how institutions are approaching this work and examine what is recorded in the data. There’s potentially interesting work here: to try and understand how this maps into institutional mission and whether the data can support it. Then how this is modelled, etc., is complicated."",Rob: we have shied away from modelling how people’s beliefs have changed over time. No one has the data and it becomes very complicated very quickly.,""George: re implementation suggestion comment in issue: P2 is not right; maybe Name Use? This thing was categorised by this curator at this time and it had this now not-kocher-to-use term. Similarly: this other group doesn’t classify things as the curators do, but they consider that it has this other meaning.",17,3,"Grant process:,Kevin: circulated documents last Friday. Would welcome attention and contributions relating to leadership.,Summary of last week’s mapping call:,Kevin: good call. Example from the Rijksmuseum with Rob performing live OmniGraffling which raised a few issues regarding how the API sits with the model. Same exemplar continues next week.,Joe: have been doing more work on own GitHub system which helps generate Mermaid diagrams from committed models. Would be interested in putting together config for colours and shapes for Linked Art. Currently built from a text file containing a simple set of tab separated triples. https://jpadfield.github.io/simple-modelling/ (docs being built),Rob: Edward and Rob have also been playing around with live-modelling/diagramming Python tooling (see Showcase1 repo),Model issues:,#346: membership of arbitrary sets,All the API responses should be able to have membership of a set resource. Object part of collection. Place part of travel route set. Person part of set of people (as opposed to a Group).,""However, we haven’t really talked about Sets much, and relationship with other entities. "",`member_of` is already a CRM property for constituting groups; so we could re-use the term via JSON-LD mapping.,""Thanasis: re: non-physical and physical auction items discussion at Oxford - this felt a little too specific at the time, but Rob’s outline (about) summarises the use cases well. Own opinion is that the semantics need explanations as to why things have been put together. "",""Rob: mixed physicality sets could be solved with their own class, but this isn’t a case where a Place would be part of the set. This might be too specific. And require reactive modelling to arising use cases. "",Thanasis: appreciate that ongoing re-modelling discussions can’t happen too frequently.,""Rob: in the ontology we could note: although the range is an E1, we expect it to be used with E22s (and other entities). In theory then, you could use a Set for anything: Places with Types (which makes no sense whatsoever); but in practice people won’t do this. So don’t prohibit weirdness. "",""Joe: grouping collection things arbitrarily, especially in relation to things which aren’t art objects, in CRM… a collection of use cases put forward as part of the Linked Art 3 project proposal. Modelling the collection may require modelling of other things: the people in this meeting only came from such-and-such specialty."

Welcome to do a presentation if you are doing work on Linked Art or semantics."",""Also, Linked Art community, as part of its work has always documented itself. George has been working on systems to create more analytic documentation to note the patterns that we are producing and give them identifiers and names. Can we slice down to the “building blocks” that are declared good by the community. Creating a data infrastructure for this and sorting the information. Also working on another document that has this level of granularity. Once it becomes more solid, can be presented here and discuss if this is a good path and strategies for naming the patterns. Documentation on site has dual levels, generic and models. This would take it down one more level, so one could use pieces to construct models according to Linked Art verified/approved patterns. It could support efforts from people coming at different angles or different software. "",Rob: Not to replace existing documentation with automatically generated documentations. But to extend and have more a specification approach. More use case and model driven. Gives an interesting tool to see how we already use the construction. Can determine extent of future changes.,Richard: Collections Trust UK link added to chat.,Rob: There is a good presentation about decolonizing the database.,""Cultural Sensitivity Fields
https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/355 
Question: How to model the flag as data, rather than a statement?"",Introduced by Richard.,Question for Linked Art: How should the URI be modeled? Statement would be straightforward. Is “Culturally Sensitive” a classification of the object? Or something else. ,Kevin: Raising licensing quality should be avoided? And how much is related to the object and how much to the labelling?,Richard: Mostly used now for Outdated terminology. If repeated in then flagged again. Images can be flagged separately if the image is sensitive but the object is not. ,Chris: Objects themselves could be sensitive and could be tagged. Richard: Work on that will likely start up after return of curators.,Rob: Yale is beginning to look a bias and racism so this could be important.,""Kevin: This is a large field, so beginning activities included in the proposal. Talking with V&A about possible collaborative project. Pitt-Rivers has a labelling project."",""The act of flagging is important, not the note at the end of it. Discerning between the flags may be too much work. "",""George: This seems to be part of CRM phases? These are classifications from the stand point of now. And values can change. Almost certainly need an event, if not a phase, for the assigning of value. "",Rob: So attribute assignment on the object. Assigns “sacred” as a type to the object?,""George: Yes, social status. It is a function. "",""See Antoine’s chat comment: yes what I’ve heard about these issues (rightsstatements.org wants to work on this) is about access so enabling what Yer says, independently from a specific UI implementation."",@Rob in principle all (most?) of TK is about the digital material and access to it. Though I guess it could also apply to the original material (in a physical exhibition space for example),Rob: Could be applied to digital or physical if needed.,Antoine: Choose to focus on digital because of access. May reflect on original but not always the case. Flag indirectly refers back to the object. So good to keep the option open. ,Rob: Limited number of URI’s (18). Should implementation recognize this URI’s or do we need a metatype “cultural sensitivity flag”.,Anotine: Use TK as first example. Richard: TK dealing with particular set of circumstances not solving all problems.,Rob: So then we would want a metatype on the flag. Or on the attribute assignment?. More consistent would be the metatype. ,Kevin: Capturing the event of the flag occurring is crucial and should be in the data.,Rob: Should it be separate from the object it is assigned to? Is it it’s own model that can be applied across institutions?,""Kevin: Need to capture that the choice was made, who undertook the act. "",""Rob: Think we get that from attributed assignment: carried out by, timespans etc. Dimensions as a comparison (who did the measuring)."",Justified this as an attribute assignment.,George: This is a pattern we would want to document as in theory applicable to any part of the model? Rob: Visual and textual can definitely be problematic.,""George: As a general pattern, should it apply across the model?"",""Rob: Can a person be culturally sensitive. George: A group, yes. A person could be sensitive. "",Chris: Question of stereotype on person?,George: Example from Canada. 1st PM MacDonald terrible policies with indigenous peoples so now a culturally sensitive person.,Rob: Places can be sensitive. Provenance can be sensitive.,""Name of object inscribed on part
https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/359 
Just duplicate information?"",Edward: Did exercise thinking about the attribute assignment about the writing of the title on the back. ,Rob: SOmeone would have done some exercise in naming or labelling. ,Edward: Do we have to know the act in order to model the attribute assignment.,Yer: Title type as inscribed so this is part.,Rob: In Getty there is classification of the name if it is on the object.,""Where the name of the object is important. We do not want to refer to the name outside of the object record. This is nice if the part is separate from the whole. The name is carried by the part of the object. Could apply to other things, eg signature. Least change to what we have now. Add property to “names”. "",George: Eloquent. Possible b/c E44 and E31.,Emmanuelle: There could be confusion. On backs of paintings there could be many labels with different titles. Some of these labels might be from exhibitions.,Rob: Other options: Make name its own resource. Problematic because everything is name. Not important that name is text. Back can carry the name separate from title. ,Attribute assignment way is difficult b/c do not know much about the actual assignment and conflicts with the exhibition case. ,""Emmanuelle: Concern about not being able to retrieve all titles, including the titles crafted for the purpose of exhibitions, when querying for titles. "",Rob: need to write up exhibition cases. And see how easy it is to get from one to the other.,So allowed carried by to refer to the physical object that carries the name.,""Agents for buyers and sellers in provenance
https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/364 
Too complex/lack of data to be in scope?"",Rob: Came up in Getty provenance work.Transaction with both buyer and seller have their own agents. Do not know what agent worked for whom. Also do not know if there was any custody for the agents.,It would be a lot of effort if we were to do this everywhere. Would have to change provenance structure to allow further partitioning. Would have to be included for all provenance activities.,Examples in issue informative.,Is it too complicated at this point? Can always defer.,Chris: really a separate study. Is the labelling good enough for querying different roles?,Richard: Don’t really have this in object record?,Rob: Not really in Yale? ,Emmanuelle: Paul Mellon did have agents. ,Rob: Come back and think about ways that this would not be too complicated.",14,2,"Announcements:,""George: CRM Sig meeting week of 19-23, for those interested joining live it is accessible virtually. Welcome to do a presentation if you are doing work on Linked Art or semantics. "",""Also, Linked Art community, as part of its work has always documented itself. George has been working on systems to create more analytic documentation to note the patterns that we are producing and give them identifiers and names. Can we slice down to the “building blocks” that are declared good by the community. Creating a data infrastructure for this and sorting the information. Also working on another document that has this level of granularity. Once it becomes more solid, can be presented here and discuss if this is a good path and strategies for naming the patterns. Documentation on site has dual levels, generic and models. This would take it down one more level, so one could use pieces to construct models according to Linked Art verified/approved patterns. It could support efforts from people coming at different angles or different software. "",Rob: Not to replace existing documentation with automatically generated documentations. But to extend and have more a specification approach. More use case and model driven. Gives an interesting tool to see how we already use the construction. Can determine extent of future changes.,Richard: Collections Trust UK link added to chat.,Rob: There is a good presentation about decolonizing the database.,""Cultural Sensitivity Fields https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/355 Question: How to model the flag as data, rather than a statement?

Is it possible for anyone to join?,George: I don’t think it’s necessary to register. It’s not a closed group. Just let me know by email.,Modelling,Issue 364,Rob: this concerns buyers and sellers both having agents in a provenance event. For example: current owner employs someone to go to the auction house and sell something on his behalf; the seller employs someone to go to the auction house and buy the item. The net result is simply that the item transfers ownership between buyer and seller.,Rob: the Getty does have considerable information relating to this. Does anyone else?,""Emmanuelle: certainly the YCBA doesn’t, officially. The reason is that it’s really hard to know when agents acted in official roles. Which is not well documented for obvious reasons. It’s rare to come by source data for that type of scenario. As I hear from my curators."",John: it’s hard to have the definite proof. Assumptions can be made from auction catalogues. You can see the sale in a catalogue and then perceive that the item shows up in someone’s collection and then infer the relationship between the owner and the (agent) buyer.,Joe: do we need a specific pattern for this? What about a nest aspect?,""Rob: provenance activities are already partitioned into different components. If we wanted to express this degree of precision, I think the model might work, however it might be very gnarly. It may not be worth documenting this level of complexity."",Joe: a straight chain might mean that most software loses the data along the way.,""Rob: X object is transferred from B to A. This is already a gross simplification of what is happening. We could easily partition this up if we had greater granularity of activities, but this is not how it’s done in CRM."",George: we should raise this conversation with the SIG. Changing the range of acquisition from physical-thing to a right would be a breaking change (and a big problem). But that doesn’t mean that the early modelling choice was the best one; and does not preclude the invention of a (or more) superclass to handle data which is being created/surfaced by groups like Linked Art.,Rob: flag as Raise to SIG? Put it on the docket for a future (not this week’s) agenda? For now leave as out-of-scope.,George: seems sensible.,""Joe: +1. Is there a way to cheat? I have a relationship here, which is more fully described in this long chain. You have the short sale A-B, satisfying the simple use case. But then nest all the complex in-between transfers A-C-D-E-F-B, etc. Therefore someone with the data can start modelling before SIG resolves pattern."",John: One Frick example sourced from the cat raisonne: https://arcade.nyarc.org/record=b1604647~S7,One more that we are sourcing from the auction catalog. https://arcade.nyarc.org/record=b1576701~S7,""Rob: re: John’s point, it’s hard to get to actual evidence for these events. We can model them, we don’t need additional ontology or docs. But we don’t know for sure that A1 was acting on behalf of A."",Rob: raise Rights Transfer issue to the SIG. The issue of being uncertain about the activities being performed is just a lack of knowledge about the agents (potentially) involved that we can’t deal with.,Issue 366,""Rob: adding to and removing things from collections. This comes up in Exhibitions, as Dave notes. The Set of objects that is the collection (auction lot, or set managed by institution, or set in exhibition). If we want to track the activities causing objects to be added or subtracted from these collections, then we need somewhere to manage that activity. Three possibles:"",On the object (all add and removes are on the object),In the collection,Separate (a new top level activity which is only the manipulation of things into sets; potentially could be a Provenance activity),Joe: how does this relate to the general concept of Groups?,""Rob: I think it’s exactly that. If Rob joined Yale on September 21st. Is that part of Rob or part of Yale? If it’s part of Yale, there’s going to be a lot of those. But if it’s part of Rob, it will include all the various groups he has joined."",Jonathan: seems to me that this should be at the Group level. We can presume the join/exit dates from the exhibition. We only need to record the exceptions.,Rob: (channelling Dave) if the connection is on the object and the object is not managed by the institution that is putting on the exhibition then we would not be able to create the link in the context of the exhibition. If I wanted to make Rob’s favourite objects from around the world…,[Edward lost connection for two minutes],Emmanuelle: you will not find any not-fully-accessioned objects on the YCBA website. We do not record presence of long-term loans.,""Joe: we do have long term loans. We have information about exhibitions which have come to us. We have paintings in Japan, so we don’t necessarily have control of the list of objects our paintings have joined."",""Richard: we do sometimes put loan objects online but not exhibition loans. When we are loaning to another institution, we do say that it is on loan and where."",""Rob: for Exhibitions, this seems like the membership / participation of an object in an exhibition is subtly different to the addition of an object to the Set. Saying that the object was in an Exhibition seems like a useful thing to be able to say. But it seems presumptuous to say that there was an activity adding my object to an exhibiting curator’s Set that they made a choice to do this. The distinction: great if objects can record their provenance, including participation in exhibitions. But if there’s a reason to be more specific about an activity that added an object into a set, then it’s the Collection’s responsibility for recording that."",""Joe: if you were using this data and queried a graph for an object, what data would you want back when you fetch its provenance? First question: where do we record this data. Second: where do we present it? How does the user get to that? How is it expressed?"",Rob: would be useful to have these links from the objects to the exhibitions but not necessarily the activity by which they were added.,Richard: trying to split in my mind the difference between workflow (movement of objects) and provenance. The fact an object was in an exhibition was true. But because it replaced another one because it is light-sensitive is also true.,""Jonathan: yes, lots of researchers are interested in this. Especially if a work was removed early. Agree that the provenance event is: the work was in the show."",Joe: where would you record the fact that four of the objects in the exhibition need to be covered on Thursdays? Intermediate events that haven’t involved the moving of the object.,""Jonathan: do not believe that this is data that we store in the system. Conservation does manage this type of thing, but we do not make collections system data like this available."",Joe: is this linked conservation data?,Thanasis: two things: One: the plan that you need to cover the thing every week. Then you have the record of whether the thing has been covered. Have not yet dealt in detail with this in Linked Conservation Data but we should do soon.,Joe: total light (rather than lux level) allowances are starting to be recorded. So data is going to exist. But can we model a more generic level?,Thanasis: Activity Plans will definitely cover that sort of thing. This is a different question to whether an object was part of a Set.,""Rob: Richard captured it well distinguishing between workflow and provenance. These things are tied together but distinct. If we need to document the action that adds/removes an object from a Set then it goes on the Set. Otherwise, responsible by the object."",Issue 362,""Rob: in order to render a web page, it would be useful to have a Linked Art based summary of an entity that doesn’t have all of the information but a subset instead. This then would be a separate API interaction, rather than about all of the knowledge. Use cases are around result sets and summaries. Showing a quick card of the object rather than a multi-page thing. Plus ones from Dave and Ethan. This is also related to search. Having the set of fields which could be exposed for the minimum representation of the object would be useful."",""Joe: wondering if you want to think of Templates here. This is a use case of pulling back a painting/image/whatever else. Request all of the data, but push it through a template or filter. This allows generic implementations rather than many unique API endpoints."",""Rob: API design-wise, having alternate representations of resources is something that lots of info systems have: formats, subsets. Can be client or server side and there are good examples of both. Impossible to get this right for every particular case. Imagine that we will need to iterate on the approach, but if there’s a useful set of properties, we might be able to say-- here is something that doesn’t require publishers to do an awful lot. "",Richard: we are building the new API for our collection site. We’ve ended up with doing a subset of results to power the results and then the full record on an object page. ,Joe: what are you querying?,Richard: Elastic,""Joe: certain aspects, however small, might be distant along long chains of graphs. Risks over-providing data."",Rob: Search. Is there a use case that doesn’t revolve around search.,""Chris: there are different experiences you want to offer. So for an app or a website, it’s not only search."",Joe: are these just hard-wired into the app?,""Chris: for example, we also do rewrites. We have to customise JSON APIs to feed different interfaces currently, rather than (currently) recomposing a single knowledge graph below it."",""Rob: for every institution to publish all of the possible subsets, it’s not going to be doable.

Thanasis: Find an AAT term to find an opportunity to describe what the object has (not ideal). George: Pro using subclasses. E14 assessment points to a different class, if we are not using that different class (it is substantial ontologically different)  then why not use E13. "",Rob: E14 list problematic. P32/P35 adds 2 more properties. Physical thing now gets another property. If we can lilith the number of classes and properties then queries become more consistent. If there is a difference between just domain and range of properties then be less reluctant to use E14 [Is this the right property? Rob? George?],""Thanasis: Likely not use condition state, likely different structures. "",Rob: Use E13 assigns physical things and condition statements.

Attribute assignment with condition state is likely the plan. Thanasis: Condition state more suitable for things that do not go into records “broken, not broken”. George: Is there a reason to be conservative to hold onto condition state. Use E14/E13. Text or type analysis. Broken etc. Condition state node does act as a phase, has time on it. Probably going to have that element on it going forward. Thanasis: Even if has to be removed in future may not be a problem. "",Rob: If Linked Art has conservation activity? Condition are assigned to attribute description. What would be the appropriate split? Joe: If both models are successful there will be a lot of overlap.

Should be happy (collaboration good) the structure covers the requirements for the Linked Art community. If LCD group needs significantly different things may not happen for 2-3 years.

Desire for artist demographic data is ballooning. Push now to acquire elements through questionnaires. Interested in a wiki based installation as a collaborative repository instead of TMS. Maybe something like ORCID. Artists are able to manage their identity, does not affect non living artists. ULAN is a key piece of Linked Art. Getty vocab and LoC are not equipped for volume of contributions, and different information, and not responsive sometimes. Can Linked Art accommodate the increased weight on identifiers that is coming out now. Aware this could result in a lot of locally managed data (what we want to avoid). "",Rob: re survey for living artists to document their identities: The Yale Gallery is involved. Jonathan is indirectly involved. ,""Sarah: Association of Art Museum Curators is umbrella group. MoMA, YUAG, PMA involved. Trying to have best practices to generate a survey for questions such as nationality, disability. This is personal. And fluidity is understood. Updating is built in (not the case for LoC, Getty). Again only applies to living artists or those with active estates. Hard to translate the artists’ language into a controlled value. "",Jonathan: Question of wiki based vs wikidata. ,Sarah: Amount of control. Relying on wikidata may not be accepted by some institutions. Small staffed institutions would be able to contribute. Governance of the wiki based system would be an issue. But worthwhile to explore. Jonathan: excited but maybe another platform?,""Rob: re wiki based, because of what is needed a created database could have the same functionality as wiki based. We would not need all the abilities of wiki based. "",""Rob: What is needed for Linked Art? Nationality, names over time, gender over time. To be able to model over time would be useful both for Linked Art and the survey."",""Erin: Can share regarding the label, work done for LINCS. "",Rob: Question of relationship (LGBTQ or LGBTQIA). Erin: going to look to Homosaurus which has looked at relationships. And will point to URI not a string. Label would be descriptive content. Structured content may not be the same. ,""Sarah: From library perspective of authorities, gathering minimal/essential data points. Goal is disambiguation but some people want to add all linked data available. "",""Rob: Lack of community process around authorities. Some can add to AAT immediately. How to maintain control while the community is encouraged to contribute. American Art Collaborative asked how to small, specialized museums contribute. Getty says they will add it but the institution doing the research do not get the credit for creation and management. Needed for more visitors and sponsors. Is there anything to be done especially on data management and cultural sense to avoid the cultural hegemony that exists on authority management."",Sarah: Possibility of meeting about this or sharing notes. ,Ethics of publishing data on living data,""Emmanuelle: Creation of a subcommittee.  Balance the research needs versus the sensitivity to other elements like gender, sexuality. Risks inherent to tracking people’s identity need to be addressed."",Rob: Anyone else working around living artists and the use/misuse of the data? Example of women artists. We need to know who are the women artists. Nationality is less of an issue. But sexuality or religion could be misused. ,""Jonathan: Framed as not collecting data that is not already out there. Public info. It can be disputed, but not making statement on validity. Not going further than a search of published materials. So not make authority statement."",Erin: Recent publication “Ethical Questions in Name Authority Control” as a reference publication: https://litwinbooks.com/books/ethical-questions-in-name-authority-control/,Sarah: NGA catalogers are reading that together. One decision is not to include gender for LC. ,Erin: Specific chapters on linked data and name authorities. ,Richard: Not collection that now. ,Emmanuelle: Living artists poses a risk of being asked the same questions over and over. ,Rob: If there is an open authority it is being published. Not open means they are being asked over and over. Current approach is if data is in an authority then will publish but do not go beyond that. ,Jonathan: From conversations wiki based allows for some control but allows individual institutions to add data. Balance of the tensions. ,Rob: Can we determine the gaps to see what should go into 1.0? What else can we be doing?,""Sarah: AAMC group getting anonymous surveys, could take themes from those to see how they could map in Linked Art. This is probably the next step. This info may go into TMS. "",If this information ends up somewhere non local what would happen? ,Next step is what are consensus information points that museums are adding?,""#419 - members_exemplified_by for Set, Group"",Works in English for example or works in the Getty.,""Better for something like unknown 14th century Italian.

Whereas, for example, if a Group prints a work, not all members of the group participated.

"",""Rob’s example code is currently based on obtaining WikiData’s internal JSON document, and extracts the properties that it can, that it has been coded to work with, and then reformats the obtained data into a Linked.Art modelled resource; the code is not based on a graph nor does it currently use SPARQL; however, it can be used offline just reading in any downloaded WikiData JSON documents of the supported types. Rob is hoping to develop a wrapper for some of the other authorities in addition to this current WikiData prototype, such that we can then merge/link the records together from the different authorities for the same entity to build up a broader/more complete view of the entity, and make that data available according the Linked.Art model/schema, which will help increase the interoperability of these useful authority datasets. Sharing of code for the prototype to follow."",Equivalence Property for Linked.Art:,""When we have multiple external authorities and we do not have a way to pick just one, Rob noted that it would be useful to have an equivalent property so that you can reference as many of them as you need to and state that they have equivalence – with the assertion of the equivalence being made by the publisher of the data. The current set of properties available for models are defined in the Linked.Art documentation here: https://linked.art/api/1.0/shared/type/ – while we have properties such as broader to note that something is the broader concept of something, there is currently a gap in the Linked.Art model with regards to stating equivalence, as such Rob is proposing the addition of the new property to help close this gap. Another question came up to decide if the new equivalent term should be available in the Properties of Types or if it should be in the Extended Properties set; if it is available in the top-level Properties of Types, the equivalent property could be used for many different use-cases; more than would be possible if the property was only made available within the Extended Properties set. One of the main benefits of the equivalent property is being able to state the equivalence between Types, such as between the Getty Vocabularies term for “Painting” and Yale’s equivalent term; this helps extend and simplify the interoperability of the data. There is also the potential need to include a back-reference. If the equivalent property is used, it would need to used consistently across the modelling so that an aggregator for instance, would not need to process all of to find the one or limited number of instances of the equivalence property to be able to follow the concept, even though using the equivalence property would be making a global-assertion, that globalness is still reliant on coming across and parsing the document or documents that contain that global-assertion. If the property is used consistently across all relevant documents, then a consumer of the data only needs to process the document or documents they are interested in to be able to follow the equivalence links."",""Also discussed was could the mapping of equivalence be mapped elsewhere, such that the equivalent properties could potentially be included in one place and then used as a lookup table? However, if this was supported, it would usually require clients to pull in this lookup table each time to parse a document, although that document itself may only reference a very small percentage of the items mapped in the lookup table; this contrasts with the additional verbosity/repetition of using the equivalent property within individual documents."",Hypertext Application Language (HAL) and Linked.Art:,""David Beaudet shared more about HAL – Hypertext Application Language – a specification for communication information about resources that are at or below or even above an endpoint. It supports patterns that could be templated, so that you could have an entity that gets filled in for an API response, or the data could be embedded in the response; there is support for pagination and traversal of links with familiar properties such as next, prev, etc. It is not a very complicated specification which is appealing, and it seems to dovetail nicely with the existing Linked.Art specification. There are a few properties that we would have to be familiar with so as not to get confused, such as it has a “type” property, but overall there aren’t any incompatibilities, and it could help with making Linked.Art APIs discoverable/consumable in a machine-readable way. It was noted that it seems to work smoothly and follow standards, and could optionally be used to extend the self-documentation of records and reference other endpoints or services that could be followed which integrate with the LOD data, such as an identity resolution service."",""By being able to leverage the HAL specification, this information could be included in LOD documents in a standards-compliant way using an existing standard, and allows metadata about data consumption and any available related data services to sit alongside the data itself. It does not prescribe any required services that an institution would need to adopt or provide in order to be compliant, allowing flexibility in adoption. Its primary benefit seems to be the ability to include the documentation about such services and the use of an API to be included/provided in place along with the LOD, rather than hoping that data consumers independently happen upon any separate documentation resources, which would otherwise be needed to get the most benefit from some datasets."",More notes about this topic are available in Linked.Art Issue #412 – https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/412.",11,2,"Non-Human Activities:,George and Rob have discussed some possible options; this topic has been added to the SIG agenda; the SIG is taking place October 12-15th where this will be discussed in more detail; more to follow on this subsequently.,WikiData to Linked.Art Mapping/Service Prototype:,""Mapping of WikiData into Linked.art, implementing the transformation, and three line webserver to walk through and find issues with the mapping; given the WikiData ID for something, it goes off and tries to find out what sort of entity it is (although this is hard to do); then it goes ahead and processes the data that can be understood by the transform and converts it into Linked.Art, which could be useful for bringing in translations and other metadata from these external authorities.

Or you may have a group of 17th Century Italian paintings and again you may want to reference an exemplar that you can highlight for illustrative purposes. Another use case is an archive of letters, where there hasn’t been the time to catalogue or digitize them all, but you could reference a concrete example that has been catalogued and digitized, and that exemplar (or a small group of exemplars from that set) would be representative of the information that the remainder of the things in the Set carry."",""Question: Is this property something that the wider group could see as being useful, or is perhaps more limited in its usefulness, and perhaps best suited to say archives, and would another modelling pattern be better suited?"",""Overall responses: Considered useful for logical groupings, conceptual things. Archives are still used / available in museums. Also shards of vases (etc) -- we know they belong together, but we don’t catalog all of the shards individually. Could point to the catalog entry for the described ones. Archaeo digs for instance."",""Point raised asking if the idea of aboutness could be used to model this instead or as well as? Noted that this is needed more at the leaf-node level. Say we have boxes and boxes of things, but we just haven’t had opportunity to catalogue everything in the boxes, but some of the things are catalogued and could be used as representative exemplars and could help someone searching (or a system) to find the box that they came from, and thus discover the other things in that box too."",""You don’t want to create specific types to group things, but by having this exemplar mechanism, there is more flexibility."",""How complete would the cataloguing of the exemplar need to be for it to be useful? If the exemplar is a reasonable stand-in for the others in the group, then it could be useful. It is not clear if this mechanism will help on a logical level, but it could be useful for users."",""Issue 427 (Entity Exemplar Templates) was separated out from this, and offers a looser mechanism, that can just define some of the most important properties of the items in a group. The Entity Exemplar Templates (Issue 427) mechanism effectively represents items conceptually in a broad way – but when you have a representative example of a collection – such as the Torosaurus skull from the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History (YPM VP.001830) that is considered the holotype, the members_exemplified_by property would be better suited to reference it."",""If you would be able to look at the exemplar, it should be as representative as possible of the other items in the set or the other items that would be included in the set if they had also been catalogued and digitized."",""How would these exemplars be used by data consumers? If a user was using a discovery environment/tool, you could index the exemplar against the Set, so when you are searching, the whole Set could be surfaced by search terms matching against the exemplar, with the user experience, where necessary, clarifying that all the surfaced things in the Set matched due to the properties catalogued in the exemplar and/or as well as possibly because some of terms matched against the individual catalogued things in the Set (depending on how the search query was written). The user interface could then allow access to all of the records included in the Set for further review. This could help make records discoverable that otherwise would not be easily found due to the limited amount of cataloguing information some records may have in a collection, such as the vase fragment case, where perhaps only a small number of the total fragments have been catalogued to any meaningful depth; the remaining records may only be very minimal, with just a title, accession number, and dimensions, for instance, compared to the exemplar records in the group, which would be selected due to their deeper level of cataloguing."",""The intention of this mechanism is to group identified sets, such as all of the paintings in the paintings department, or all of the known fragmentary shards that constitute a given vase."",""For things that are currently part of the set, the thing would be a member_of the Set; but being able to say what other things are like the things currently in the Set, is where having a representative example is helpful."",""It was asked, in the scope note of a Linked.art Set, is a Set considered closed or open? In the overall context of Linked Data, entities are generally considered open, and other users could effectively assert that something else was a member of another’s Set. However, the practicality or appropriateness of doing so, doesn’t always make this possible or likely, so ontologically the defined sets would act as though they were closed sets."",""Someone has said that this is the exemplar for this set, even if it is not the most representative thing in this set, and computation of the properties may reveal another thing that is more exemplary, however the importance is that this item has been called out by someone as the exemplar. The exemplar may not have been chosen because it is the most representative property-wise of the entire set, but may be chosen because it is the most recognized, and most easily brings to mind the properties of things in the set, than a more obscure, but mathematically more correct exemplar would."",""Would we need to be able to reference more than one exemplar for a Set? Perhaps a small number of exemplars would better represent the group than any single example could. Also if there were differences in the property values between the exemplars, that could reveal more about the scope of the things in the Set than a single exemplar likely could. The members_exemplified_by property is defined with  multiplicity enabled, so would be able to reference more than one thing."",https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/427 – Entity Exemplar vs Templates,""How in a machine-accessible way do we say, for example, that this Set contains items that are made of terracotta, or that this box contains letters written by Trimble?"",""Should we create computed (conceptual) entities which do not necessarily have or do not describe any individual thing in reality, but where knowing the properties that apply universally to the items in the Set would be helpful?"",""The template mechanism is much closer to the “shapes approach”, i.e. that the members of this given Set meet this templated definition, i.e. the properties of the templated (non-existent) thing. You would only define properties in the template that represented all of the items in the Set, such as that all the items in the Set are made of terracotta."",It seems that there are more potential issues with the templating mechanism; how would it be clearly conveyed that something was just conceptual (a template) rather than a representation of something real? This would need to be clearly defined and conveyed. Could a new class or property just be used to help convey this.,""Scoped contexts? This mechanism could help make the modelling cleaner, so it would be consistent in the raw JSON-LD with the classes and properties used to model real things, but when translated to RDF, a HumanMadeObject for example, could be translated to for example HumanMadeObjectTemplate by virtue of being modelled under the exemplified_by property of Type. The usage of scoped contexts could be advantageous here. Good documentation and potentially a required property such as classified_as (aat:computed) “Computed Entity” would call out these things as not be representations of real physical things for the purposes of filtering and for those just consuming the raw JSON, rather than accessing the data as RDF via a graph store.",13,3,"The meeting in two weeks (1st December) overlaps with the Museum Computer Group Conference in the UK, so there may be some absences.

There may be a reasonably easy way for them, however, to be included in the data. For example – by adding a classification, with the caveat that you cannot carry out your own burial. The new participated in property in CRM may also be useful. Activities could have parts to divide the classifications of who performed what. Feels overly detailed for something that isn’t directly art-related. Options: add participated in to the model; or defer to waiting for CRMsoc to fulfill the requirement?"",Richard: is there a difference between what we’re saying biographically about someone and what they might be depicted doing in an artwork?,Rob: if you wanted describe a painting of the baptism of Napoleon. And it’s an entirely fictional scene. Then you need to say that the VisualItem represents an Event with Napoleon participating in baptism. Classifying the reality of the event is not our concern.,Richard: thinking of staged photography. Might be an artist depicted doing things which didn’t happen in their real life.,""Julien (from the chat): An overall question perhaps, when a property from CIDOC-CRM is integrated into Linked Art, is the inverse property also being integrated automatically?"",Rob: Not automatically. Also intentionally not always so that path navigation is clearer.,Rob: any objections to including the event participation stuff?,Kevin: anxious that this is the thin end of a scope-creep wedge for parts of a model which Linked Art won’t be responsible for.,Rob: there are good use cases: e.g. went on an art collecting tour. Some events which aren’t really art are actually still useful when you want to talk about the art or its participants.,""Kevin: at what point should this be farmed out to people responsible for describing those things? But yes, utility wins."",Antoine: why P11 and not P12 from the CRM? Could be that it’s quite difficult to make the distinction. Must say that I’m a bit guilty about (?) not implementing this in the Europeana Data Model.,Rob: there’s a balance between active / passive to strike. Imagine a bubble in which an event is occurring. The sinking of the Titanic occurred in the presence of some water. And an iceberg. It’s not especially interesting although it may be true. The painting of the sitter occurred in the presence of the seat the sitter was sitting on. Describing participation is overall more interesting.,""Antoine: it does address some doubts, which is good. But it does bring us towards having some opinion on what counts in someone’s biography and potentially straying out of scope."",""Rob: at least for this use-case, we do know that they are participants rather than just present. Who carries out an auction? Is it only the auctioneer? If you are in the audience are you a participant or does it occur in your presence? Agree– difficult to distinguish. People will probably decide according to their own interpretation."",""Antoine: for EDM, we did mint a semantically-equivalent property for P12. We knew we couldn’t capture all the available roles, so we picked the most general. Just some kind of involvement in an event. Suppose that P11 is general and P14 is a specialisation of P11? P12 would answer Sjors’ use case without committing to too much semantics. We can go for P11, but does this level bring us something of value?"",""Rob: P12 vs P11. Primary distinction is that P11 is the range, for actors. P12 is for anything, which could include actors. But they’re both passive, not active. If we went for P12, then we should scope it to more than just actors."",Bree: Would it apply to the participants in marina abramovic work where they are sitting across from her or actively participating in other pieces of her work?,Thanasis: also my understanding. P14 does have an implication of intention to participate in the event. But it may be interpreted slightly wider than that. RE: Bree’s case (from the chat)-- the result of people’s presence may be causal. Perhaps what we are talking about is P14 with a defined role. Not too much overhead to define another property. ,Thanasis: burial is a problem because the object being buried is no longer a person.,""Rob: if you were ever a person, immediately after you die, you are still a person."",Thanasis: ah OK. That’s cheating.,Rob: absolutely it is. But it is in the docs :),Thanasis: maybe we don’t need to introduce a new property in that case.,Rob: the child (or party)’s participation is necessary or the event cannot be carried out.,Thanasis (from the chat): we should remove P14 and have only P12 ;-),Rob: we don’t want to introduce complexity for the sake of absolute purity.,""Rob: we can embark on some data collection. What data do we actually have other than getting married and going on holiday? Also, Thanasis, can we ask Martin how he interprets causal here."",Rob: “This property describes the active participation of an instance of E39 Actor in an instance of E7 Activity. It implies causal or legal responsibility.”,""Thanasis: the scope note does imply legal (or something else, didn’t hear) responsibility. Looks like the scope note could use some clarifying improvement."",Rob: will email SIG. Folks please look at what other event data you have about people who are involved in art which would be useful to record in a Linked Art context. Then we can adjudicate on the nature of involvement and later decide on which property to use.,Issue 460,Dave: this is a question about the Linked Art data service from the Getty. What exactly are we hoping to get out of this and how will it help?,Rob: the Type definition spec should be implemented as a real API. There’s a long history about whether broader should be pure CRM or skos. Some disparity between the Linked Art spec and the current implementation of the Getty data.,Dave: so this is so we can extend below the AAT with custom concepts.,Rob: yes.,""Rob: then, member of, is the inclusion of the concept in some set. For example, types of name (display, sorting, etc). There’s not necessarily a broader concept."",""Dave: ah, yes, creating a set from a hierarchy."",""Daniel: there have been cases where we haven’t been able to find a term in AAT. Usually we go to the maintainers, and ask for inclusion. Sometimes this isn’t possible and information is specific to our own data model. So we are creating a local thesaurus. Perhaps this particular pattern would be helpful more widely. We are not modelling out the AAT data, simply referring to the concepts as IDs."",Rob: you can definitely use this as a pattern now. It should work fine. Types should be moved in the docs from the Shared section into the main Endpoints section.,Issue 461,Dave: noticed that if a Concept is sub-classified in different graphs then the context is lost in a complete graph. All the metatypes merge. The context is always available in the JSON but when it’s pulled together it’s merged in the graph. Does this break the model?,""Rob: The example in the issue, in particular, is an erroneous conflict. However, yes, it is possible to encounter this issue. Absolutely a problem."",Dave: should we move the Type classifications into the Concepts endpoint?,""Daniel: when we’re in this situation, then we need to use an AttributeAssignment, using the assigned property and giving a classification too. That way your assertion is context-specific."",""Rob: RE: should the metatypes be in a different document? This would make it easier to see, but the rationale is that you want to be able to filter the classifications. We also don’t want to require understanding of all the specific AAT statements. The metatype enables a user to display/process unknown specific classifications by interpreting a handful of known metatypes (brief text, etc.). "",Rob: the vocabulary is also still not finalised. Issue is outstanding.,Daniel: noticed that Description is classified as a brief text. Getty have been assigning multiple types and not metatypes.,Rob: this was a valid pattern but at some point we switched to requiring nesting; so Getty will need to adapt at some point. However not totally wrong to do it the other way. But better to align with the spec.",18,1,"Rob: Kevin, Rob and Dr Clare Llewellyn (from U. Edinburgh) have won a grant for developing exhibitions.

Could then stop using transfer “title” “custody” could just do transfer to/from. Kevin: have the limitations of how to articulate provenance. Difficulties in CRM. Needs work. How does this affect LA?

Separate class would help with distinction in linguistic objects. Could use “referred to by” Drop the metaclassification because referred to by class. And clearer for JSON. Making “statement” and new class would go along with the hierarchy. Not making it a new class would not have the RDF benefits but easier for JSON.,Should we work on ontology? Or only work on profiling? ,""Kevin: Could be a slippery slope by working on ontology. Would CRM ever merge this in? Or is this a temporary ontology? Rob: Given work with ISO, ISO 7.1 is completely stable, so it will be hard for several years to make major changes. No enthusiasm for “set” or “non-human actors” in ISO 7. Probably no movement for 3 years. Kevin: 3 years not inappropriate about of time, would it merge after that? Rob: Could add to LA, and could result in more people coming to LA to add their ideas. Erin: 3 years is accurate. Philippe and I are working with ISO and could have answers in next 6 weeks. Is this an all or nothing question? Rob: Not possible for it to be all or nothing. Could be significant changes in adoption. Observable component being discussed by CRM. Time is observable, concepts are not. This has been there for some time. Precedents for changing the extensions in the hierarchy. And precedent for bringing things into PSY that are not in base. Erin: would LA maintain this independently forever? Rob: Reasonable, horrifying thought. LA could determine it is essential and CRM determine it is out of scope. Not that big a burden if LA writes out the ontology. Dave: Would it have effect on release of version 1.0? Rob: “Statement” would have huge effect, Statement class instead of LinguisticObject. The others would not have a big effect. Could use super property of “transfer” in RDF. But probably should not do because splitting from CRM. Transfer, Set, Non Human Actors would not have effect on release. Kevin: Sensible to split Statement then. Bree: is the length of time between creating these and possible acceptance into CRM an advantage especially if these become fundamental additions? Gives more leverage for adding to CRM. How bad is it to add in and then remove? Rob: Let’s not consider Statement for now. Advantage for use. Value in doing it sooner. Could go to 2.0 or 1.x if not breaking at JSON. Richard: Should we bring the people to decide this into a room to reach agreement? Rob: Maybe add a day to Edinburgh. May not be possible. Have this on part of an ontology call. Lots of interest in this as a call."",Kevin: How to deal with Statement. Should be resolved before 1.0. Flag a meeting so everyone attends?

Maybe call on May 4. ,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/478 ,""Cannot have different identifiers for the same object. Cannot put “identified_by” on identifiers. Cannot currently have a display label for a name. Should we add “identified_by” for the Identifier and Name classes? Daniel: Is there a technical reason why not? We use “classified_by” currently. Rob: Two accession number examples: OCLC and LoC example. The identified_by property is  recursive but we already have that issue. Daniel: It would be useful and no known likely clashes as it hasn’t been available previously. Rob: Not to avoid a type, but so interface is easier or more appropriate if all it has is type. Also works for dimensions. Daniel: Use of “identified_by” shouldn’t replace the use of “classified_by”, but because of institution labeling differences its availability would be useful, as different institutions could use the same classification such as “accession number” (AAT 300312355), while adding their own custom display label for that term, via the “identified_by” property, such as “Yale Accession Number”, “Getty Museum Object Number” or “Frick Accession Number”. Rob: The addition of “identified_by” would also useful if the specific form of say a Name is unknown, i.e. we don’t have required classifications, rather they are just recommended, as that could lead to the use of generic classifications such as classifying a “note” as a “note” when it wasn’t possible to be more specific, which doesn’t add much value to the data. Instead the availability of “identified_by” would allow more clarity and specificity to be provided in the data in a human readable way, without necessitating the creation of custom classifications and the infrastructure needed to support their retrieval (dereferencing) and use."",""Daniel: Getty is replacing the Museum Collection site with our brand-new Linked.art and IIIF LOD-based version tomorrow (March 24th) – links to the Linked.art LOD records and IIIF manifests are also included in most of the new web pages, so will allow anyone who is curious to explore those too.

Rob: No, because it would be inconsistent with transfer classes. Paying money is a common scenario, but could also be an exchange of objects (painting swap). The other object performs the same function as the money. Question of payment for different things (900 for painting, 100 for frame). That works: "",overall,painting,ownership: painting (a to b),payment: 900 (b to a),frame,ownership: frame (a to b),payment: 100 (b to a),Could split up the parts of the payment into separate provenance activities.

Its machine learning model was primarily trained on contemporary images, and now more work is being done to train the model with earlier and more varied images. An object detection confidence level of at least 80% was chosen as the threshold for determining whether to include a detected annotation or not. The primary pieces of information stored from the Vitrivr output are the descriptive term associated with the detected object within the image, such as “person” or “cat”, the confidence level, and the X,Y,W,H coordinates associated with the bounding box that would encompass the detected object within the source image that was provided as input to the Vitrivr detection software. The output from Vitrvir in PIA’s implementation is then stored in a SQLite database, which was found to be an easier way to work with the data and makes it easily accessible for incorporation into other uses, such as for generating the Web Annotations that annotate the IIIF Manifests with the recognized object metadata."",IIIF manifests are generated dynamically.

Part refers to object, but parent does not refer to children (would be 1000s of links in parent record then). But as a developer would want to know all of the children records. How do you get from parent to children? Use HAL for underscore links (thanks Dave). Know how to get to from parent to children, but do not know the syntax. Would be nice to have something semantic. Should we use an API or should it be more semantic/specific? Daniel - same issue at Getty, tried to follow pattern of embedding children within parent but that is impossible. Using Sparql as solution, raw JSON-LD in graph store. Only parent reference in child, then get information by querying that way. Does everything have to be semantic, example of Discovery in IIIF. How would one power the API in this case? For Getty exporting from TMS and now static file. No live look ups. If not coming from Sparql would need another database and query that. Benefit to being able to work with data as JSON-LD. Rob: Yale example. LIve query. Daniel: Does Yale run Sparql query for each page? Rob: They are in regular index, look up into an inverted index. Dave: Follow link from August 31 2021 in github chat. Key is from HAL. Any response formatted like this gives a way to navigate at the same level to the next page/set of results. Can drill down look at higher collection level. Purpose of structures is to provide minimal required to allow navigation through an API w/o prior knowledge of API’s capabilities. Rob: Put same data up side by side in Activity Stream model and a HAL model to determine what is the best way to go. Rob will take a stab at that, Dave will check the HAL model. Dave: Question to be answered is how to format a response that contains a list of items? Describe type of query as general search query, how is that search response formatted? We do not know what those searches are yet. Does it make sense to determine what those searches are, and let that inform the type of response. Issue 455 is that issue (Enumerate named queries). API has link from object to artist, but not from artist to all objects produced by them. Would be good to describe all of the possible permutations that would be necessary for LA.

Rob: In archiving little distinction between containers and the hierarchy of fonds and subfonds etc. Relationship between items and physical location not 1:1.

Part of collection with first and last pages. Small number of hits in a single page (short response). Dave: Collection page as entity type is confusing. More like a rendering of an entity?

Kevin: Distinction between intellectual set here and categorical sets? Rob: In archiving little distinction between containers and the hierarchy of fonds and subfonds etc. Relationship between items and physical location not 1:1. Kevin: unsure why this needs a new concept of the intellectual structure? Is there a parallel with the structures we already are doing. Rob: in a world where everything is described we would not have to. But in actual archives, the descriptions are so backlogged that the descriptions are basically zero (just linear feet). Having a set of linear feet is necessary and having a set within that feet is necessary and then having a way to describe specific members within that is necessary."

Sometimes additional boxes that should be part of the archive were misplaced, and then later found."",""Jessica shared that the intellectual arrangement tends to be more important to the archivist, versus the physical arrangement which is more important to the end user."",""What is important to the archivist isn’t necessarily important to the end user who just wants to see the item, i.e. where it is on a shelf is more important for access and viewing, than how it is intellectually arranged, which tends to be more conceptual."",""It could be a one-to-one with a folder, or if it is one-to-one; the fact that it is a physical folder may not be as interesting versus that they are being collected and arranged together. If they are physically together it would be easier to retrieve them, but if there is an intellectual arrangement that is not represented at the physical arrangement, that could be worth capturing."",""The importance of the intellectual vs physical arrangement can depend on the archive, sometimes distinguishing and modeling both is important and other times not as much."",""For the Duchamp Archive (https://www.duchamparchives.org) there are very large numbers of individually described items, but these are not necessarily linked from the finding aid."",""Also where is the physical embodiment of digital content, such as where are the cassette tapes, video tapes or harddrives (the physical media) that store the digital content, on some shelf in the archives, not necessarily well cataloged, versus the digital rendition of the same content which may be better cataloged."",""Typically documenting physical things, but the answer as to what is more important tends to be an either/or; we generally start cataloging with the physical thing and then building out the hierarchy, and sometimes this is the intellectual arrangement that would be wanted too, but when they are different how do these different arrangements get represented in the data and then modeled into the LOD."",""The set may contain a notional amount of items, perhaps it was in a certain arrangement at one time, and then some of the archive was separated out and went elsewhere, and now there is a different intellectual arrangement to represent."",""You would want to distinguish the intellectual content from the carrier, i.e. the text within a document is a separate intellectual entity than the document carrying that content."",""For born-digital, such as an email, the thinking was that if you have the physical hierarchy as the primary hierarchy, you could not have a digital item as part of the physical hierarchy, as the digital content itself (the email) in its true digital form has no physical embodiment, but a copy of said email on physical media or rented cloud storage, could represent as a proxy the digital content. It could be part of the same intellectual arrangement, but not part of the same physical hierarchy. But you are not able to archive something without having the physical thing, such as a hard-drive, or the cloud-storage that you are paying for, but without such storage (for digital content) then you are not archiving, so these are needed, and could (maybe?) be the part that is referenced at the physical arrangement level."",""The digital representation should still exist somewhere, but when it comes to the arrangement, there is a digital space where the arrangement exists; you don’t have a desk where the items are laid out and arranged, but they exist in a digital space and they may exist in several digital spaces at the same time (different copies of the same content or backups of the content)."",Are we trying to get a sense of what types of data or cataloging levels may exists?,""It is important to have a good theoretical model that can represent everything, and if we rely on the physical representations (such as a harddrive) to be able to perform the modeling for digital content, but if one hasn’t been cataloged how can it be represented? Maybe the carrier (e.g. the harddrive) can be modeled as an equivalent to a usual physical carrier such as a box or folder."",Maybe the real physical folder in the box on the shelf contains a DVD. But cataloging practices vary and who will be using the model and how can we ensure that the model can accommodate the data.,""Bree: A collection of programs, a collection of posters, and then organized by years, but online they could be arranged differently and sometimes in multiple ephemeral ways; the way that they were arranged digitally could be completely different to how they were arranged physically. The physical items could also have different representations, such as a poster, which could have its original Adobe Illustrator (for example) design file in the marketing department, but the archive would also have a physical print out of the poster which would be stored, so both of those representations would need tracking too."",Julien: Photographic Archive of SSFS,""The SSFS Archive (https://archiv.sgv-sstp.ch) is cataloged at the item level, then organized into groupings, such as albums."",""Once the cataloging has been completed, they may be physically separated for long term storage, even though the intellectual arrangement would remain."",""Digital surrogates and the negatives and prints. At the moment the digital surrogate is created from the negative, but not a representation of the digital media upon which the digital surrogate is stored. The model could possibly be extended to add another entry point to record the digital media storing the digital surrogate."",""Rob: We have seen member of, we have seen digital members of a set, and having the distinction of a digital object be a member of a a physical set and carried by a physical contain, e.g. contains_members_of, where the shelf has some of the members of the intellectual set but not all of them.

Alternatively know certain items are in folders, in box, in room etc. Box 3, folder 12 holds/contains letters. Can also say Box 3 holds folder 12. Members of archive are at bottom. Sami: hard to go from theoretical to actual collection. The DAMS contains the items. In this example part of a folder is known but no intellectual information. Richard: Upcoming project could make this more concrete in practice. Sami: If using ArchiveSpace or Access to Memory then would have this all in one system. What are the opportunities for inference? Rob: Inferencing can cause more problems, example of if listed in two places. Going up is easier. Downward inferencing is attractive but more problematic. Much of this is re-application of the model.

Capitalization of parts of name as example. Signaling the conformity may be preferable. If the user understands the cataloging standard they can convert the name to their standards.

So many standards that cannot force that AAT is only used. Must be normative in some way that if you have a certain case then a certain vocabulary must be used. No way to say here is all of the vocabulary one will ever need. Daniel: Have seen patterns not in AAT and editors have been receptive to creating new names.

Similar to EODEM for Cidoc. Works for borrowing and lending of objects in institutions. If while in early adopter stage then opens the door for other institutions. Collections Trust also uses it as data stack. Work with Art UK as a stakeholder. LA could work with Collections Trust, Art UK, Knowledge Integration to use LA. Richard has had conversations with Kevin Gosling about using this. Prototype had usual problems with data from multiple institutions. LA does have greater hope because it generalizes down to same object. Rob and Kevin Page had conversation with Kevin Gosling about this topic. Collections Trust wants to get all data in and then decide what they can and cannot do with it. Possible funding from AHRC, Oxford has until next April to apply for follow on funding. What does it look like to have the csv’s from 600 museums? Use machine learning for similar columns to provide mapping. Maybe branch off of Art UK’s enhancement to transform to LA.

O’Keeffe example, very early and things have moved since adoption. After Lux, need to get documentation for 1.0 out and it is not going to change for 18 months. After that things should be backwards compatible. George when it comes time to lock LA, could we bring in things like Shaql. Documented extensions will be very valuable.

Raemy;Bree Midavaine;Erin Canning;Kevin Page,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/461,"Lux reception recap. Fire forced it outside.
Face to face: 1st morning vocabularies and AAT terms: required, recommended, and listed. Rubric up for this rationale.
Agreed rights model for structured data. Rights statements in text form. If there is a uri (Creative Commons) type of a right.
Two API discussions: Include where items do not naturally fit, linguistic objects in human made object. Also looked at how Lux uses links in records.
Talked about exhibition and how to fit into API endpoints. Will not fit into existing endpoints. Need new endpoints that is neither textual nor visual. Exhibition could be in multiple languages so not linguistic. Need new API endpoint, to avoid confusion.
Context specific assertions, wicked problem. Hard unsolvable. Assertion must live in two places. Title of a work specific to exhibition, exh should be able to say this title is for the purpose of the exh, and the item should be able to say it has a different title. Has to be able to load in multiple places.
Agreed to inject classes, transfer pattern. But will not do anything with non human actors. 
Improvements to person and group modeling. 
Archives and exemplified by patterns. Actual instance that exemplifies the archive or a template that could be applied. “Members exemplified by” and “members contained within”. Template would be a blank node. Actual instance is reference. 
Versioning requirements. Three different version numbers contained in JSON and HAL. 1 for model, 1 for API, 1 for local changes. 


Meta-typing rationale. 
Meta-type vs parallel type. Conclusion to be a meta-type. For statements not too much difference. Classifications on a person impossible to use parallel (siblings eg British and female and of African descent; nationality, gender, ethnicity would be siblings). Other classifications not meta-typed would not know what is what. Should be consistent everywhere. Cannot walk back would break. Daniel: Could complicate the Sparql query but would return result. From Lux, makes it easier to index, bring together a property path. From graph query perspective, document based architecture, meta-type do not fit into the properties of the document. Would want to know a painter is an occupation, without a single triple store then the occupationness of painterness would not be managed. Daniel: On person record, are we making a global assertion that painter is an occupation, but what if we wanted to say painter is a role? Is it harmful to have two global assertions? Not disastrous, painter as occupation / professional activity, versus role. Exhibitions makes it a mess. In Exh, activity vs set. Need to be careful not reusing concepts in a conflicting way. Daniel: Technique vs role (Photographer vs photography) some use the incorrect one. Creating multiple properties is not scalable. Not so brief text like an essay probably needs its own entity. For brief text “type of work” meta-type (eg monograph). This is a statement is what brief text is trying to convey. Wording is what is throwing people off. Could put statement into the label, probably not wrong in AAT. 

Daniel:
Putting together a change history for 0.8 and 1.0. Mapping for home pages for example. Identity as well. Share with Rob to make sure it is correct. 
Docs needed label in github good place to start. 62 issues. ",8,6,"Lux reception recap. Fire forced it outside. Face to face: 1st morning vocabularies and AAT terms: required, recommended, and listed. Rubric up for this rationale. Agreed rights model for structured data. Rights statements in text form. If there is a uri (Creative Commons) type of a right. Two API discussions: Include where items do not naturally fit, linguistic objects in human made object. Also looked at how Lux uses links in records. Talked about exhibition and how to fit into API endpoints. Will not fit into existing endpoints. Need new endpoints that is neither textual nor visual. Exhibition could be in multiple languages so not linguistic. Need new API endpoint, to avoid confusion. Context specific assertions, wicked problem. Hard unsolvable. Assertion must live in two places. Title of a work specific to exhibition, exh should be able to say this title is for the purpose of the exh, and the item should be able to say it has a different title. Has to be able to load in multiple places. Agreed to inject classes, transfer pattern."

Ties in with sales pitch intro.,""Rob: Technology discussion vs design. Python, React etc are these too technical. "",Daniel: would be helpful to share. Range of things to share. Short synopsis of the process. Graph Store was what made LUX practical. Would we be able to achieve same performance with other tools. Would help convince to move to something more efficient. Audience dependent. Does Marc logic support Federation? Technology overview interesting. Tried X but Y was better. ,Decision making process of technology and architecture. How they interact. Gets people from good idea to this is how to do it. ,""Dave: Why it’s necessary to use semantic technologies for LUX. Rob: Started out with Solr but had to move to semantic. Solr has trouble with joins beyond one level. Triple store too semantic. Dave: Any quantifiable results: Performance, feasibility? If you want something like LUX do not go down these roads. "",Want to get the code ready to be visible and usable without having to have Rob or Kelly available. ,""Attributed By vs Assigned By (Rob)
https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/515 "",Made mistake in LUX. Not consistent how used “attributed by” and “assigned by”. ,What’s the relationship between the thing that has the property and the object. ,""If the resource that has the property is the subject of the relationship, then it's attributed_by the AA."",""If the resource that has the property is the object of the relationship, then it's assigned_by the AA."",""Tricky because in CRM all relationships have inverses. Painting to identifier: Painting is subject. Would be valid to use assigned by rather than attributed by but does not fit with the modeling. Blank nodes in the graph such as dimensions being assigned, identifier being assigned, those are all “assigned_by”. Daniel what would you do if it was not a blank node? All embedded assignments are “assigned_by”. Rob: I think that is “attributed_by” the attribute assignment is on the production which is the subject. Artist carries out the production. Daniel: Will have to make some breaking changes to be compliant with 1.0 so this will have to be changed. Rob: P177 has property_type so can be explicit in what the relationship is. George: Labels make sense. Attribute to the subject the object. Have to figure out what is the subject in the order of things. Looking at what is baked into Arches. May be the wrong way. May also be wrong in the LA documentation. Technical correct is subject "",E13 Attribute Assignment. P140 assigned attribute to (was attributed by): E1 CRM entity,E13 Attribute Assignment. P141 assigned (was assigned by): E1 ,If identified was assigned by a group then it is the other way around. George: Within Arches context do not indicate what was assigned to. Rob: Fine in LA. HMO has identified want to say who it was assigned by. Only need to have the carried_out_by on the attribute assignment. George: If it is dumped in a graph without context then do not know it was assigned to a certain thing. Rob: Lots of assignments are unique to the HMO. Daniel: Examples and a paragraph how to think through is useful. Do have attributed_by for titles. Could have unpredictable modeling for the same thing. Rob: Next step is inventory of where we use attribute assignments and make sure they match up with definition. Production attribute assignment is the biggest one that does fit in to the model. If one wants to make a claim about a random part of the graph that’s where it gets tricky. ,George: Also ran into a problem of a contextual identifier in the provenance data. Lot 001 is uninteresting if you do not know the sale it came from. For Provenance kept basic pattern added attributed assignment subnode and used motived_by for events. Example: Lot 001 was attributed by Christie’s because of Sale. Rob: Sounds familiar may be how LUX is modeled. Daniel: Exhibition title example. Did use attribute assignment. Attributed assignment was involved in a set motivated by an activity. Like George’s idea of placed in as a regular identifier. Rob: Ran into this in LUX. Context specific identifiers. Archival record example. “Used_specific_object” to sort. Can change to “motivated_by”. (Does not have to be a temporal object). Daniel: Double use of motivated_by? Example motivated_by set which was motivated_by exhibition. Set will not have an ID how do we point to it? ,Rob will make new issue with “motivated_by” as the property to use. ,Add used_for to Set https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/514 ,No way to point from set to exhibition in current API. ,""Any objections? Daniel: Sounds beneficial. Is this similar to exhibition title that would reference a set of objects. Rob: It would be in the top level for the set. Daniel: Usually points to a single activity. Within the activity added motivated_by but that’s done one level above the set. Rob: It should be events point to objects. Maybe should use used_specific_object Daniel: How do you get from set to its context? Exhibition title example. Rob: For context specific would want to address that higher up. Rob: For this issue do we have the direction right and the documentation. Child is the event. Kevin: Do not want to miss the inverse case. Rob: LUX also uses it for curatorial.

It is very flexible and it would be hard to not have it.,George: certainty is also a case. This can happen everywhere. ,Rob: use case in arches: putting attribute assignments everywhere is not a good idea. Will kill the software. In LUX they are allowed everywhere BUT when you tried to move this into Arches it breaks it.,Rob: suggestion: can we have a list of places where according to the API you can expect attribute assignments here. The model can say you can use them everywhere but if you put them in places that aren’t indicated in the API then this won’t necessarily be processeable etc. So if this is super important information should come back to Linked.Art and ask it to be part of the api.,For the remaining open issues: please put a “+” next to the link if you think we should talk about that next week in the Netherlands.,""No call in two weeks, we will reconvene in four weeks.",15,1,"Announcements - F2F next Friday at Rijksmuseum, 20 signed up for in person, last chance to get added to the list now…"",""Update on IMLS bid - Proposal had to be updated to be a single year project with kickoff meeting in Washington DC, then deep dive meetings at set of organisations to see how Linked Art/Lux could be implemented at the organization.

Need to remove “page/” from id’s. George: for public audience is interesting. Technically you are saying this object is for the public. Ran into this with provenance with notes (some not meant for general public). Is there a notion of name graph in JSON-LD. Becomes very meta. Adds another layer of JSON-LD around the record. Dave: Can it modeled as a right surrounding the object’s records? If audience is internal processing, at Yale “last modified” is example, _lastmodified, _visibility etc. Could be similar for thumbnails. Functionality is not about the HMO, but what we should make public. "",""Provenance is subtly different. In Arches, information about the record is important. George: Some data especially free text would only be for an internal audience. Daniel: have a data store, but do not have non public records in this data store. Internal only data store would only be available on network. Can have individual components in a record be marked public or private. "",""Dave: Is the labeling for collection management system correct? “Assigned_by” vs “carried_out-by”. Should be “used_specific_object” meaning NGA’s TMS. Dave’s pattern would not be thrown out by a validator just it would not be recognized. We are making a difference between category of an identifier and source of an identifier. Advantage of AttributeAssignment is can have multiple. And can find all TMS minted identifiers across institutions. TMS does not exist in AAT, maybe use gallery system (for down the road). Edward: Rijks uses obsolete (so does Daniel) also used for previously assigned makers. Rob: There is a difference between no longer true and no longer preferred. "",May bring these needs to the Getty vocabularies. May have to add specific software products to AAT. Wikidata may be sufficiently stable to use. ,""Groups within NGA question? Do we have id’s for registrars? Up to you, could assign to just the NGA or could assign to specific department. NGA is probably the correct level for this identifier. Use institution for assigning id’s, use departments for who is responsible for the object. "",""Begin of the begin and end of the end may not align perfectly. Often a + - 5 years (search date). Daniel: It is inclusive, often with wide ranges. Want to show the name to the user, but have the system search the range. "",""Technique as attribute assignment for the dimension. Need to determine what width belongs with what height when there are multiple dimensions. Issue #251. Can have dimensions as they appear on screen, but if you want to associate certain ones together then have to use technique and local identifier pattern. This was the best solution."",From the chat: Could https://ror.org/ be leveraged as a fallback if there is nothing in ULAN? Departments are sometimes listed in ROR?

General agreement, is yes it would."",""Kevin Page: There may also be an Enriching Exhibitions workshop happening the same week. If there is some overlap, it could help with some of the costs. The location of the IIIF Conference may not be ideal for many however. Is the Conference planning to offer some/all sessions online too, either real-time or recorded, to increase accessibility?"",Issues,Issue #461 – How to differentiate the use of a classification term between two objects loaded into a graph?,""Everytime that you have a URI and make a statement about it, all of those statements will be merged together (in a triple store, or a quad store in some cases) – that is, those statements/assertions will all be linked to that particular URI – as such how do we disambiguate the assertions that you make between the differing contexts that those assertions were made in? When the JSON-LD is loaded into a graph store, the context for those assertions is usually lost. To some extent this is the point, the graph store is merging together these assertions which all hold true about the URI in some context, however, being able to determine from the graph store in which context those assertions were made is near impossible."",""Although the kernel of this conversion dates back more than two years, there has been a lot of discussion about this issue particularly in the past two months as we are getting closer to finalizing the model for version 1.0, and it is important to determine how we resolve this issue as most of the solutions necessarily affect how we model the data, and as such could affect the specification of the model."",How do we keep multiple assertions separate in different contexts?,The various solutions that have been proposed are as follows (from the ticket):,""Reification: Use AttributeAssignment everywhere; however their use doesn't solve the label or type issue, and they are very verbose."",""New Properties: Devolve the AttributeAssignment into a property; ditto, but trades verbosity for a non-interoperable approach outside Linked Art."",""Named Graphs: Replaces one technology problem with another, and probably doesn't solve everything anyway. In a triple store we have: subject, predicate, object; in a quad store we also have the option to include a context URI associated with each triple, and this can be used to disambiguate the context in which the assertion was made and can be used to prevent the conflation of assertions onto the same URI; however we can only use the optional context URI once per quad in a quad store, and if the context URI has already been used by an institution for another purpose, it cannot be used to help solve this issue, so it's not a holistic solution."",""New URIs: We could manage our own URI space when collisions are detected, or beg Patricia for new URIs in AAT. However, this doesn't solve non-AAT problems. There may need to be a lot more AAT terms minted to help disambiguate (i.e. creating new terms that are specific enough not to need to be meta-typed, but we would potentially need a lot of new terms to do this)."",""Modified URIs: Per Rob’s comment a few up (in the ticket), we could have a convention of adding fragments to external URIs to align them with the usage to avoid collisions. This solves the problem, but would be very costly to apply across the board, and breaks any hope of inter-graph connectedness. This approach would be a slight variation on the New URIs solution, to have them minted by convention everywhere, rather than by authority in one place."",""Status Quo: Document the challenge, document the possible solutions, and have adopters pick their internal flavor separately from external interoperability flavor."",We have agreed that we could use the equivalent property to convey the term instead of using it as the id of the Type – this allows us to avoid making assertions about the term globally; rather you make the assertion about the blank Type node (or you could add your own local id to the Type node if desired). https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/461#issuecomment-1902240872):,AAT already has two URIs for the concepts in the example: https://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=painting&logic=AND&note=&page=1&subjectid=300053343 and https://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=&logic=AND&note=&subjectid=300033618 so the example is kind of wrong,""Transforming data from existing content management systems; it is hard to detect when such conflation is happening, and it can be difficult to understand why you get the results you do (and how to untangle the conflation)?"",""If the proxy pattern makes enough peoples’ lives easier maybe it is worth the additional complexity? Everyone would need to adopt this pattern if we mandated it, but is this a problem that we need to solve at the JSON-LD layer? It is really a current technology problem, not a modeling problem, and could be solved downstream of the JSON-LD with better tooling both for working with JSON-as-JSON, and for expanding Linked.Art JSON-LD to triples/quads for graph store usage."",""Antoine: Everyone using a graph store, whenever there are statements we could avoid loading some of the assertions, and this could work in some cases, but in others"",""Rob: On metatypes; if for example you have a Person instance and you want to convey their nationality, their culture, etc., there aren’t specific properties on the Person entity to convey these various attributes; instead we place these terms into the singular classified_as property and use a metatype to differentiate the classifications from each other – otherwise how would we know which classification was being used to convey the nationality versus the culture, etc."",""Kevin: Notes that there are multiple points here; agrees that it is primarily a data issue, however, makes him suspicious about whether we could truly solve this issue in a singular way; we need to be able to handle this in some way, notes that this isn’t currently on the list of priorities, but it likely should be; one of the benefits of the Linked.Art specification is that it defines just enough (inter)operability, doesn’t mandate too much. How do we signal this? Are there common usages of the terms that we could signal, for example through versioning clauses? Can this always be detected on the way in? Instinct is yes, but are there cases that could fall outside of the common pattern? If we want to solve this through tooling, we need to be able to solve this holistically/reliably."",""David notes that this came up in the SHACL validator, where multiple assertions were appearing even though only one was defined (as they were being conflated by the graph store that the SHACL validator was retrieving the imported information from)."",Kevin: We should continue working as a community to straighten out the data to unify things across institutions as best we can.,""David notes one of the suggestions was Linked.Art publishing effectively metatyped-types, that could be used instead?"",""George: To sum up, presently, is pro-status quo, but that is helped by using metatypes (from AAT) to disambiguate the use of the properties. If we had subtypes of CRM types we could use those instead and would solve this issue, but that isn’t necessarily available. It becomes hard to sort out certain things, the triple store becomes messy; both of the things that are being talked about are classes – they are classes, not instances of things – while the multiple assertions may lose some of their context in the graph store, they are not false, the graph store is just returning all of the assertions it knows about the thing (the URI); the metatypes are already adding complexity and proxying these complicates it further, so can we avoid the proxying?"",""Kevin: A good summary; what flows is the notion of interoperability; where does the responsibility lie, the model, the API, beyond? Linked.Art helps create the space to help people work on the problem, but the documentation needs to help clarify how we do this."",""Rob: Seems like there is general agreement that this is a problem, but that the solution is most likely to be accomplished in the data; we will find these situations where we want to use the same URI to talk about different properties, that you would want to use different URIs? Whose problem is it? Don’t burden everyone to solve a problem for the “few”. If we are in the context of a triple store, we could convert the “status quo” pattern to the equivalent pattern – if you have the technology problem, then you would use the “equivalent” pattern (for your graph stores) as you expand the data from JSON-LD to triples; this would allow the continued use of the existing/status quo pattern in the JSON-LD without having to impose a different and often more complex modeling structure on all users to solve the problem for a subset of domains. Better tooling to help with graph expansion and better caching when using the JSON-LD as JSON, would help solve the technology problems without further complicating the modeling."",""We would recommend when putting data into a triple store, convert the “status quo” pattern to the equivalent pattern for the benefit of the triple store, without transferring the modeling burden to everyone."",""Rob: The equivalent pattern solves the URI assertion conflation issue, and is the most elegant of the proposed solutions, it trades the id for equivalent, and we are not introducing a tonne of reification which would happen through AttributeAssignment. "",""We will continue to discuss in the ticket (#461), should the “equivalent” pattern be legal in the API?

A comment would disappear, do we prefer that the comment disappears (Developer only)? Support for comments in JSON, but JSON does have have comments. Edward is being hypothetical, so if there were comments in JSON we would want to use it, but would want it to round trip. Could rename it so known that it is to be used only be developers.

Proposal: https://linked.art/api/1.0/ecosystem/search/ "",Collisions between LA and ActivityStreams person / duration. Rob created context only for ActivityStreams. Follows IIIF usage. Name map and summary map. IIIF calls name label. ActivityStreams does not use none / @none. Because of this it is easier to not have label and _label in LA. ,New proposal is to use separate context only for ActivityStreams. Classes from LA overrides language and summary. Getty uses ActivityStreams for a few uses. Does it W3C? Could we switch at some point? https://data.getty.edu/museum/collection/activity-stream,Lux carries name of set and summary of set. ,This should be separate only used for search responses and ActivityStream responses. Would not use this context for a document. Would not use regular LA for this because does not have the correct terms. Edward: If you know how to walk an ActivityStream API and dump into a triple store it will work. Collection page type does not get the same as HMO page. Does not pollute the name space.

Exhibitions was first example. ,Rob: Two main usecases. Works of the exhibition. And Performances. Abstract work of a performance art piece to describe parts. Need to have the ability to say a part of the abstract work is part of the whole. ,Daniel: Los Angeles exhibition example. Grouping it on the work case not on the event case. Rob: Have to give example of how to do the partitioning. Daniel: Probably does not need the symbolic adornment. Rob: Trade off is introducing at API level a new property name. Because of class hierarchy can’t just use “part_of”. “Conceptually_part” and “Conceptually_part_of”. Julien: Is conceptually a bit long? Daniel: Sometimes verbosity is better than ambiguity. ,Daniel: Some properties do not follow pattern: CamelCase example SameAs. Rob: Occurs during is another example.

We are using it for different CRM properties P9, P46, also spatial partitioning. Could we do the same for PropositionalObject? Rob: It will compact but it will not expand. Antoine: Why does it work for events? Rob: For temporal things always use P9. Rob: If someone were to say there is a linguistic object that is part of some other thing (P148). As long as underlying system does not do any inference then it would compact. It would fall back down to lower level and use conceptual. May need to prove this in JSON-LD in both directions."",Rob: If we cannot us “part_of” then use “conceptually_part_of” and “conceptually_part” if we can round trip then we just use “part_of”. Rob: By specifying on every class then it will use that class definition in every case. Daniel localized definition. Rob: If we ever want to say a linguistic object is part of an abstract work then we would need another property. Daniel Can we add the property on that side since it is rarer. Rob: We could use “part_of” for abstract to abstract. But if it is linguistic to abstract then need “conceptually_part_of”. Is it more confusing to say sometimes you can use part of?

Daniel: just a numeric property does not allow us to clarify the intent of the number. “Parts, children etc”. Daniel: Uses component object parts. And count sum total.
