# Meeting Minutes

I extracted the meeting minutes of the IIIF Discovery Technical Specification Group, covering the period from December 2017 to March 2023, as well as the Linked Art Community minutes from 2019 to November 2023. These documents were originally stored in Google Docs. To facilitate this process, I used a dedicated tool developed by [the Gift of Script](https://www.pbainbridge.co.uk/), created by Phil Bainbridge. This tool was able to efficiently extract key information from the documents, including file names, direct links to files, and paragraph content, streamlining access to and analysis of these valuable resources. The extracted data was organised and saved as CSV files.
