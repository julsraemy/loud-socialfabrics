1,Core Properties,"There are a few core properties that every resource should have for it to be a useful part of the world of Linked Open Data:

@context is a reference to the context mapping which determines how to interpret the JSON as Linked Open Data. It is not a property of the entity being described, but of the document. It must be present.
id captures the URI that identifies the object. Every resource must have exactly one id, and it must be an HTTP URI.
type captures the class of the object, or rdf:type in RDF. Every resource must have exactly one class. This allows software to align the data model with an internal, object oriented class based implementation.
_label captures a human readable label as a string, intended for developers or other people reading the data to understand what they are looking at. Every resource should have exactly one label, and must not have more than one. It is just a string, and does not have a language associated with it -- if multiple languages are available for the content, then implementations can choose which is most likely to be valuable for a developer looking at the data.",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/object/22
2,Types and Classifications,"CIDOC-CRM is a framework that must be extended via additional vocabularies and ontologies to be useful. The provided mechanism for doing this is the classified_as property, which refers to a term from a controlled vocabulary. This is in contrast to the type property described above, which is used for CIDOC-CRM defined classes, and a few extensions as needed. The classified_as property is thus a way to be more specific about the sort of entity, while maintaining the core information as the class using type. Controlled vocabulary entries should not be used with type, nor classes used with classified_as.

While any external vocabulary of terms can be used, the Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus is used whenever possible for consistency and that it is already widespread in the museum domain. The set of terms that have been identified as useful are listed in the community best-practices for recommendations, and within the documentation of the model when a particular choice is essential for interoperability.

Use cases for this pattern are in almost every example, but include:

The object being an art object
The type of an art object being a painting
The type of a description being a materials statement
The type of an identifier being an accession number
The type of an organization being a museum
The type of a place being a gallery",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/object/23
3,Types of Types,"A common pattern is to not only classify main entities, but also to classify the types themselves in order to know what sort of type it is, without recognizing all of them individually. This is important when the set of first degree types is not easily enumerable, such as classifications for the type of object or work. If the set of vocabulary terms that can normally be used without further extension can be established, then this pattern is not used. This is also not needed when the relationship from the entity to the first degree type clarifies this, such as the motivation or about properties.

Use cases for this pattern include:

The classification is the type of object or work of the physical thing (e.g. Painting)
The classification is the type of text of the statement (e.g. Dimensions Statement)
The classification is the nationality of the person (e.g. Swiss)",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/object/24
4,Names and Identifiers for a Resource,"As the _label property is intended as internal documentation for the data, it is strongly recommended that every resource that should be rendered to an end user also have at least one specific name. The name could be for an object, a person, a group, an event or anything else. This pattern uses the identified_by property, with a Name resource. The value of the name is given in the content property of the Name.

It is somewhat unintuitive to think of a name as identifying the resource it is associated with, as names are typically not unique. However, as the name itself is uniquely identified rather than just an anonymous string, they are no longer a shared label and instead the particular instance of a name is uniquely associated with the resource. With this formulation, the name instance does uniquely identify the resource.

If there is more than one name given, then there should be one that is classified_as the primary name for use. This is done by adding the Primary Name (aat:300404670) term to it. There should be exactly one primary title given per language.

Names are also part of human communication, and can have the Linguistic features of the model associated with them, such as having a particular language, or having translations.",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/object/25
5,Identifiers,"Many resources of interest are also given external identifiers, such as accession numbers for objects, ORCIDs for people or groups, lot numbers for auctions, and so forth. Identifiers are represented in a very similar way to names, but instead use the Identifier class. Identifiers will normally have a classification determining which sort of identifier it is, to distinguish between internal repository system assigned numbers from museum assigned accession numbers, for example.

As Identifiers and Names use the same identified_by property, the JSON will frequently have mixed classes in the array. Unlike Names, Identifiers are not part of human language and thus cannot have translations or a language associated with them.",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/object/26
6,Statements about a Resource,"In many cases, current data does not support the level of specificity that the full ontology allows, or the information is simply best expressed in human-readable form. For example, instead of a completely modeled set of parts with materials, many museum collection management systems allow only a single human-readable string for the ""medium"" or ""materials statement"". The same is true in many other situations, including rights or allowable usage statements, dimensions, edition statements and so forth. Any time that there is a description of the resource, with or without qualification as to the type of description, then this pattern can be used to record the descriptive text.

The pattern makes use of the LinguisticObject class that is used to identify a particular piece of textual content. These Linguistic Objects are then refered to by any other resource. They maintain the statement's text in the content property, and the language of the statement (if known) in the language property.

Use cases for this pattern include:

General description of the resource
Materials statement for an object
Attribution statement for an image
Biography for a person
Dimensions statement for a part of an object
Note that both Names and Statements can have Names (e.g. ""Former Title"", ""Supplied Description"") and Statements (such as the source of the name or statement), however best practice is to only use these sparingly.",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/object/27
7,Parts,"Describing the hierarchy of parts of resources is a core pattern for having increasingly granular or specific descriptions. The advantage of partitioning is that more specific information can be provided about each part, as a thing separate from the whole. This pattern covers the spectrum of different classes used in the model, from physical and textual, to temporal or geographic. Parts are given using the properties part (from the whole to the part) or part_of (from the part to the whole).

Use cases for this pattern include:

Delineating physical components or aspects of an object, such as the frame being part of the painting, or the recto side being part of the page.
Separating a long period or event into smaller sections, such as battles within a war, or the activities of different people during the production of an object.
Separating geographical locations into smaller subdivisions, such as that the neighborhood is part of the city, which is in turn part of the state.
Partitioning a text into segments, such as that the paragraph is part of a chapter, which is in turn part of the entire book",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/object/28
8,Membership,"Membership in a set is treated slightly differently. A set can have no members and still be a set, whereas if you destroy the last part of an object, it no longer exists. For example, a department of an organization (a Group) might not have any members due to the retirement of the last member, but there is a still an identifiable, ongoing group that would hopefully gain members when new hires are made. Membership is given using the member or member_of property, instead of the corresponding part and part_of.

Use cases for the membership pattern include:

A curator is a member of the paintings department of the museum.
A painting is part of the collection of a the museum.
An identifier is part of the set of identifiers that collectively make up the accession numbers assigned to paintings by the museum.",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/group/2
9,Events and Activities,"Patterns are not only within a single entity, but also in the way that we manage relationships between entities. While many systems link straight from one an object to its creator, for example, CIDOC-CRM and thus Linked Art instead uses an intermediate entity that represents the activity of the artist in creating the object. This enables us to associate time, place, actors, techniques, other objects and more with the creation activity, rather than needing many individual relationships.

The key participants in those different types of events are:

the Object being acted upon,
the Actors (people or organizations) that perform the activity,
the Locations at which the activity occurs,
and the Time at which it occurs.
The general pattern is to create a resource for the Activity or Event, and associate the participants with that resource. The relationships for time (timespan) and place (took_place_at) are relevant to Events that happen without the direct cause being a human action, and the relationship for the actor (carried_out_by) is added to those for human activities. The relationship to the Object is dependent on the type of Event or Activity, which are discussed in more detail in the specific sections.

There are both subclasses of Activity, such as Acquisition, Production and AttributeAssignment, and classifications associated with them to be more specific, either as a technique like glassblowing (aat:300053932), or via classified_as for more general terms like gift giving (aat:aat:300404212) to clarify the sort of Acquisition.",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/event/3
10,Time Span Details,"The minimal timespan model is given above, with just the begin_of_the_begin and an end_of_the_end properties to record the beginning of the span, and the end of the span. The end of the span is not included in the span, and thus if the end_of_the_end is ""1500-01-01T00:00:00Z"", then the 1500 is not included, and the last mathematical moment of the last day of December 1499 is the very end.

It is very useful to have a Name for the TimeSpan that gives a human readable version of the machine readable timestamps and durations. This uses the pattern given above for naming things, and might be displayed to user directly, whereas the other properties could be used for matching a time-based search.

There are other properties for TimeSpan instances that are useful when the exact span of time is not certain.

end_of_the_begin: This property is another datetime that gives the latest possible datetime for the beginning of the span.
begin_of_the_end: This property is yet another datetime that gives the earliest possible datetime for the end of the span.
duration: This property refers to a Dimension, that describes the amount of time that the activity or event took, within the span of time. As the property defines the type of dimension, the Dimension instance does not need to be classified_as any particular Type ... it is always a duration.",Baseline Patterns,,,https://linked.art/example/event/4
11,Base Production Activity,"The first activity in an object's lifecycle is its creation, or Production. The relationship to the object that was produced by the activity (produced) is added to the general activity model, along with the time, location and actors. This follows the base pattern for activities.",Object Production and Destruction,,,https://linked.art/example/object/60
12,Techniques,"If there is a particular technique known to have been used in the creation of the object, this can be expressed using the technique property, referring to a controlled vocabulary term for the technique. This should be used to capture specific techniques or methods, and the base classified_as property used for more general classifications of the activity.",Object Production and Destruction,Techniques and Classifications,,https://linked.art/example/object/61
13,Classifications,"Classifications for production events are less common than techniques, but still possible. These classifications must not be techniques, but instead some assertion about the activity generally. This could include whether the activity was a minor contribution to the overall work, or whether the activity was performed legally or not.",Object Production and Destruction,Techniques and Classifications,,https://linked.art/example/object/62
14,Multiple Artists,"If there are multiple artists collaborating on the same piece of artwork, then we follow the partitioning pattern of creating separate parts of the main Production activity. Each of these components captures the details of one particular artist's role in the production of the object. This allows us to assert different properties for each artist's contribution, including different times, techniques, locations or influences.

For consistency, it is recommended that this pattern also be used for production activities when only one artist is known, such that it is easier to add further contributors to the work without restructuring the content.",Object Production and Destruction,,,https://linked.art/example/object/63
15,Inspiration or Copies,"Some artworks are copies of, or clearly directly inspired by, others. This relationship with another work can be captured with the influenced_by property of the Production activity. The copy could be from memory or with the copied object physically present, and it could be a faithful reproduction or merely recognizably similar.",Object Production and Destruction,Objects Related to the Production,,https://linked.art/example/object/64
16,Reproduction from an Identifiable Source,"Many objects are created from a source, such as a photograph being printed from a negative, a print created from a woodcut, or a sculpture made from a cast. The use of the particular source can be captured as part of the description of the Production of the object using the used_specific_object property.

All of the art objects created from the same source show the same image, be it flat or three dimensional. The source also shows the same image, albiet likely somehow reversed. The image is modeled as a VisualItem that all of the physical objects, including the source object, show. This allows us to group the objects together based on their provenance.",Object Production and Destruction,Objects Related to the Production,,https://linked.art/example/object/65
17,Attribution of a Group,"Even if the artist's or artists' identity is not known exactly, the person or persons may be known to have been part of a group, such as the workshop of a more famous ""master"". In this case, the Group that represents the workshop can be the actor that carries out the Production: this does not mean that every member of the group participated, just that at least one of them did, in the same way that saying that a document was written by an organization does not imply all employees contributed to the text.

We can use the influenced_by property on the Formation (the creation) of the group to connect it to a known person -- the ""master"" of the workshop in the example use case. The ""master"" might not have participated in the group, or even been alive when it was formed, and hence does not necessarily form the group or is even a member of it.",Object Production and Destruction,Attributions,,https://linked.art/example/object/66
18,Uncertain or Changing Attributions,"A piece of information associated with historical artworks that can change as research and understanding improves is the identity of the artist that produced it. The actor that is referenced in carried_out_by is the current opinion, but previous attributions can still be recorded.

In order to clearly separate the previous thinking from current, the model explicitly includes the act of assigning the previous artist as an AttributeAssignment. The assignment activity assigns the previous artist's role as part of the main Production, but has an ""obsolete"" classification to indicate that it is no longer believed to be correct. A ""possibly"" classification would indicate that the attribution of the artist is uncertain.

The Attribute Assignment pattern is described in more detail in the assertions section of the documentation.",Object Production and Destruction,Attributions,,https://linked.art/example/object/67
19,Production by Removal,"It is also possible for an object to come into documentary existence when it is removed from a larger object. The production of the part is simply part of the production of the whole, but until it is removed, it does not need a separate identity or existence.

This occurs reasonably frequently, for both valid and unscrupulous motivations. In the work of conservation, it is often necessary to remove a tiny flake of an object to experiment with, before applying the method to the whole. If there are unexpected side effects of the experiment, then the whole object is saved at the expense of an unnoticeable change. It is important to know that the sample was produced in the past and removed in the present, rather than it was created de novo in the present.

A second scenario when this occurs is unfortunately common. If an object, such as a medieval manuscript, can be sold for more by splitting it up into parts and selling each part individually, then unscrupulous sellers will do just that. Rather than sell an innocuous book of hours to a single buyer, instead each illumination can be sold individually and then the remaining text-bearing pages either dumped or sold over time at a greatly reduced price. This dispersal of manuscripts still occurs today.

In order to model this, instead of a Production, the object is removed_by a PartRemoval activity. That activity is just like all other activities, other than it has a diminished property that refers to the whole object from which the part was removed. The removed object can have a Production event, but it should be a part of the Production of the whole. As it is unlikely that there is any new information about the removed part, this is not normally useful.",Object Production and Destruction,,,"https://linked.art/example/object/68
https://linked.art/example/object/69 "
20,Destruction ,"The end of the provenance chain of an object is when it is known to have been destroyed. Loss of the object leaves the chain open ended as it might be recovered in the future, however if the object is destroyed then there is no coming back. Objects should, thus, only be recorded as destroyed if they are known to be so.

The model uses a Destruction class that represents the going out of existence of the object. A destruction only applies to a single object, and thus every object has their own destruction, even if that destruction was caused by the same wider event or activity. This means that the Destruction is not carried_out_by an actor, but instead (as in the following section) another activity causes the destruction.",Object Production and Destruction,,,https://linked.art/example/object/70
21,Cause of Destruction,"As discussed above, the same event or activity could be the cause of the destruction of many individual objects. A museum burning down or otherwise being destroyed would destroy many objects, including the building itself. On a smaller scale, an individual destruction could be caused by a particular activity of an individual.

In order to distinguish between the destruction itself and its cause, we use the caused_by relationship between the Destruction and the Activity or Event that caused it. The event should be described and classified as any other event in the model.",Object Production and Destruction,Destruction ,,https://linked.art/example/object/71
22,Other Specific Activities,"If there are other activities that are specific to the particular object and do not have any identity of their own beyond the object, then that activity can be described with a relationship from the object to the activity, rather than from the activity to the object. In these cases the description of the activity will end up embedded completely within the object's record, in the same way that the publication of a work is embedded within the work's record. In the more general case, when the activity has its own identity (such as an auction or conservation work on the object) then the event will instead refer to the object and the object must not refer to the event. The relationship for this situation is used_for between the object and the activity.",Object Production and Destruction,,,
23,Dimensions,"The physical dimensions of an object, such as height, width, diameter or weight, are included in the dimension property, and consist of three primary pieces of information:

The numeric value in value.
The type of dimension (e.g. height vs width) in classified_as, referencing an external vocabulary of dimension types.
The unit used to align the value with the real world such as inches, pounds or seconds. The unit should also be given from a controlled vocabulary.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,,,https://linked.art/example/object/49
24,Dimension Statement,"If the dimension text is not recorded in a way that is condusive to generating the full set, then it can be given as a LinguisticObject, classifed as dimensions by reference to aat:300435430, and the text provided in content. This is an example of the Statements base pattern.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,Dimensions,,https://linked.art/example/object/50
25,Dimension Display Labels,"Another method is to have the dimensions in the data include a human readable label for the value that the dimension is representing. This allows clients to present the data in a particular style, rather than having to generate the text from the dimension value, unit and type.

This same approach can be used on many data structures and is merely being called out here to compare with the machine oriented view of just the data structure, and the human oriented view of just the full description as a statement.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,Dimensions,,https://linked.art/example/object/51
26,Measurements of Dimensions,"In some contexts, it is also important to have more information about how the dimensions were measured. This could be useful, for example, to distinguish the time and method by which the measurement was taken, or to know who used which instrument in a conservation research setting to promote accuracy and reusability of results.

In order to build upon the dimension model described above, the model adds an AttributeAssignment activity to the Dimension which is the measuring activity, following the Assertion pattern. The Dimension is assigned_by the AttributeAssignment, to the object which has the dimension. In this particular case, as dimensions are specific to the object, and the dimension property is explicit in the model already, there is no need to link from the AttributeAssignment back to the object, or to give the property that is being assigned. It is permitted, but no new information is being added and hence it is not recommended.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,Dimensions,,https://linked.art/example/object/52
27,Colors,"The main colors of an object can be determined and record in two very different ways - by capturing a very specific value for the wavelength of the light or composition of the color (in a Red/Green/Blue colorspace, for example), or categorizing the object into more broader, subjective color types (""pale green"", ""ochre""). The first approach might be done with instruments measuring the reflected light off the original, or via digital photography and computing the color from the resulting digital image. The second approach is likely carried out by a curator in describing the object in a collection management system, hopefully using a controlled set of terms. As it is desirable to have only a single place to look for information, the model for color tries to capture both of these possibilities at once in as simple a way as possible, allowing either or both to happen for any given color.

Measurements record a Dimension, and thus we create an instance of the class to record the color, even if the measurement is a categorization. The dimension has a value and unit, just like the more obvious physical dimensions described above. For an RGB colorspace, the value must be converted into an integer from the more traditional three-part hexadecimal value, as values are always decimalized. This allows the true value to be recorded. The dimension can also be classified_as a particular color family -- the object has a color which is a green color, for example. Either or both of these patterns can be used, and multiple dimensions using this pattern can be recorded without having to match up which categories map to which values",Objects: Physical Characteristics,Dimensions,,https://linked.art/example/object/53
28,Shapes,"While some combinations of dimensions can give a sense of the shape of the object, it is also often useful to be more explicit. For example, a shield-shaped painting (perhaps due to being painted on an actual shield) would likely still only have height and width given. Without the additional information of the shape, it might be concluded that the painting is rectangular. Similarly, a circular object could be mistaken as a square, as the height and width would be the same in either case.

Shapes are given as classifications on the object via the classified_as property. The classification is then further classified as being a shape, with the term aat:300056273, in the same way that being a painting is further classified as being the type of work.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,,,https://linked.art/example/object/54
29,Materials,"Objects are created using different materials, such as canvas or marble. These are recorded using the made_of property on the object directly. The materials are the type of material, rather than the specific bits of matter and therefore refer to entries in external vocabularies. When possible, it is good to use this model, and combined with the parts model described in the next section, allows for a comprehensive set of information about which parts are which sizes, shapes, colors, and made of which materials.

Note that the type-of-type pattern is not needed for materials, like it is for shape, as they have their own Material class that is used to distinguish them.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,,,https://linked.art/example/object/55
30,Materials Statement,"Similarly to dimensions statements, it is possible to describe the materials using a LinguisticObject classified as being about the materials of the object via aat:300435429.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,Materials,,https://linked.art/example/object/56
31,Environmental conditions,"Depending on their material, objects need to be kept in appropriate environmental conditions so that they do not deteriorate. Such conditions are often recommendations by conservators and collection care experts and can be documented using a LinguisticObject classified as being about the environmental conditions of the object via aat:300229535.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,,,https://linked.art/example/object/57
32,Parts,"As described in the baseline patterns, one of the main modeling paradigms used is to separate parts of resources from the whole. Physical objects are particularly amenable to this, and allows reuse of the rest of the model as needed. The parts do not need to be physically separable without destroying the object, but do need to be objectively definable in terms of the matter that makes it up. For example, the arm of a sculpture could have dimensions and materials, but while an arch-shaped space in a rock formation might have dimensions, it could not be removed, nor is it made of anything, and thus it is not a part.

Physical parts are given using the part property, and use the same HumanMadeObject class, as per the full object. The classified_as property can be used to be more specific as to the sort of part, in this case the support for the painting, which is in turn made of canvas. The type of part is then further classified as aat:300241583 to ensure that it can be distinguished as a part-type, rather than an object-type.

The model does not have a separate parts statement to describe this in a human-readable way, as this is traditionally done using the materials statement as demonstrated above.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,,,https://linked.art/example/object/58
33,Sides of an Object,"While some artworks can be treated as two dimensional, as the only part of interest is the front of a flat surface such as a painting, drawing or photograph, there are many other objects where it is desirable to record information separately about the front and back, or any number of other sides.

This pattern allows separate identities for the recto and verso of a page, the obverse and reverse of a coin, in the same manner as the frame or canvas of a painting. The use of the classification aat:300133025 (artwork) is important to distinguish between objects that should be treated as the complete artwork, and objects that are either parts of it, or those that it is part of.",Objects: Physical Characteristics,Parts,,https://linked.art/example/object/59
34,Description,"The main description of the object is provided in the same manner as other such texts; as the content of a LinguisticObject resource. The classification for descriptions is (aat:300411780). The description can include any content that describes the object, and is useful primarily for display to a human user.",Objects: Aboutness,,,https://linked.art/example/object/36
35,Depiction,"Many sorts of artwork depict things that can be pointed out in the artwork. These could be identifiable entities, such as a known Person or Object with a name or identifier, or unidentifiable (perhaps fictional) instances of a class of entity, such as a depiction of a battle but not any particular battle. For example a portrait depicts the person sitting for it, or a sketch of a generic landscape depicts a place even if it's not a particular, known location. The depiction pattern describes what is in the artwork's image.

This is modeled using the represents property on the VisualItem, which refers to the entity that is being depicted.",Objects: Aboutness,Physical Object and Visual Work,,https://linked.art/example/object/37
36,Subject,"Subjects are the concepts or things that the artwork evokes, as opposed to an object (real or imaginary) that is depicted by the artwork. For example, a portrait of a military commander in full regalia on a battlefield depicts the person and the place, but could be interpreted to have a subject of ""war"". A painting with an allusion to a piece of literature does not depict the literature, but instead evokes it as a subject. This could be thought of as what the artwork is about rather than what can be seen, or as why the content in the artwork is present.

The model for subject is that the VisualObject is about the subject, which is a Type instance.",Objects: Aboutness,Physical Object and Visual Work,,https://linked.art/example/object/38 
37,Style Classification,"Styles are a categorization of the aesthetic qualities of the work being described, and can come from important features, techniques, locations, times or artistic movements. Styles might include ""geometric"", ""abstract"", and ""limited palette"". It is considered that all styles are aesthetic rather than cultural, but the aesthetic style may be related to a particular culture.

The distinction that all styles are aesthetic is somewhat controversial, but simplifies the model significantly at very little cost. A clear example is a perfect imitation of a Navajo dream-catcher made by a factory in China cannot be said to be culturally Navajo as an object, but the image of the object can be said to have an aesthetic that is related to the Navajo culture.

The style is associated with the object using the classified_as property, and must be a reference to an appropriate vocabulary. It is associated with the VisualItem that is shown by the object, to reinforce that it is the way the object looks that determines the style, not the physicality of its production. The style property could be thought of as how the content is presented. In order to distinguish styles from other classifications, the style itself has a classified_as of aat:300015646.",Objects: Aboutness,Physical Object and Visual Work,,https://linked.art/example/object/39
38,Other Classifications,"Other classifications can also be assigned to the object's content. If it is possible to say that ""the artistic content of this object is an X"", then X can be included in the set of classifications using the classified_as property on the VisualItem. This could include classifications such as ""Landscape"" or ""Allusion"", compared to classifications that are derived from the physical nature of the object such as a ""Painting"", ""Photograph"" or ""Sculpture"" which are associated with the object.

39,Objects Carrying Textual Works,The description of textual works are covered in detail in the Document section of the model.,Objects: Aboutness,Textual and Visual Works,,https://linked.art/example/object/41
40,"Single Object, Multiple Works","A single object might carry both significant textual content and separate visual works. For example an exhibition catalog carries its text and, via its illustrations, the visual content of the objects that were exhibited. In this case we would simply list each of the works.",Objects: Aboutness,Textual and Visual Works,,https://linked.art/example/object/42
41,"Single Object, Single Textual and Visual Work","However, in the poster case, there is only a single work that has both important visual and textual attributes. In this case we do not want to give the impression that they are separate and instead use the partitioning pattern.
",Objects: Aboutness,Textual and Visual Works,,https://linked.art/example/object/43
42,Related Objects,"A list of related objects is often known for any given object, however the reason for the relation is not recorded. These objects might be physically similar, they may have been created by the same artist, they might have been exhibited together or they might just be both highlights of the current institution and share no observable features. In this circumstance, the best that can be done is to record that there is some relationship without any specificity as to the details. If there are more details known about the relationship then more specific patterns should be used instead.

The model uses an AttributeAssignment activity to relate the two objects together. This allows additional information to be associated with the activity, such as a label, name or classification if known. The relationship has a direction, slightly paradoxically from the entity which has an attributed_by property to the AttributeAssignment, to the entity which is assigned. The property can be given using assigned_property, with the value being the name of the property.",Objects: Aboutness,,,https://linked.art/example/object/44
43,Ownership,"The current owner of the object should be referenced with transferred_title_to in the most recent Acquisition that transferred_title_of the object. These transfers are described in detail in the Acquistion section.

To make the current owner easier to find from the object's description, the owner should also be referenced with current_owner from the object itself. There are further modeling details available about People and Organizations that might own objects.",Objects: Provenance,,,https://linked.art/example/object/46
44,Custody,"Similarly, the current custodian of the object should be referenced with the transferred_custody_to in the most recent TransferOfCustody, in the same way as the current owner is referenced from the most recent Acquisition. There is an equivalent property to current_owner for custody, which is current_custodian. This is described in more detail in the section on custody.

Note that objects are owned by legal entities, such as people or organizations. If there is a department or person that is not the owner but is responsible for the object, then that actor is the current_custodian.",Objects: Provenance,,,https://linked.art/example/object/47
45,Location,"The current location of the object is given using the current_location property. This can give a reference to a gallery or specific part of a facility, or be used for the general address of the organization where the object is currently held. There are further modeling details available about Places.",Objects: Provenance,,,https://linked.art/example/object/48
46,Credit / Attribution Statement,"It is important to be able to give a credit or attribution statement that should be displayed along with the object. For example, a painting that has been donated might have the requirement to state who the donor was. This is modeled using the statement pattern as a LinguisticObject, that is classified_as aat:300026687 - the term for ""acknowledgements"". The text is given in the content property.",Objects: Rights Information,,,https://linked.art/example/object/72
47,Rights Statement,"For general statements about rights that have not been aligned with any other controlled vocabularies such as rightsstatements.org, the information can be provided in the same way as for a credit or attribution. The difference is that it is classified_as aat:300435434 - the term for license or legal statements.",Objects: Rights Information,,,https://linked.art/example/object/73
48,RightsStatements.org Assertions,"There is a recent effort to standardize rights statements, described at rightsstatements.org. Twelve basic rights statements were identified and given URIs to identify them. If any of these statements apply, it is useful to use these URIs to ensure that client systems can process them the in the same way.

These assertions are modeled as individual Rights, which are then classified_as the rights statement URI. A label, via_label, can also be given to provide clarity for developers looking at the data in the same way as Type objects.",Objects: Rights Information,Rights Assertions,,https://linked.art/example/object/74
49,Digital Objects,"All Digital Objects share some basic characteristics, regardless of their particular nature. The basic patterns of Name, Identifier, Classification, and Statement all apply in the regular way. Beyond the baseline, digital objects can have the following descriptive features:

Access Point - The URLs where the object is available. These may also treated as Digital Objects in their own right, but typically only the URL is given.
Format - The format of a digital object is its media type, often called a MIME type, given as a string
Standard - Many digital objects further conform to standard specifications, which can be referenced using the conforms_to property. This differs from format, as there may not be a media type for the specification, and from classified_as which is a broader classification (Image, rather than conforming to the standard for JPEG 2000)
Dimensions - Digital dimensions follow the same pattern as physical dimensions, but might use different types (file size) or the same (height, width for images) and different units (bytes, pixels).
Creation - Digital Objects are created by Creation events rather than Production events, but otherwise have the same activity model.",Digital Integration,,,https://linked.art/example/digital/1 
50,Digital Images,"Many of the entities that are described using Linked Art will have digital images that depict them. These images are useful for building compelling user interfaces for the data, and often take a prominent position in those interfaces.

One image might show many different entities, of different types. An image of an artist standing next to one of her paintings would show both the artist (a Person) and the painting (a HumanMadeObject). Further, the same image might be shown by many digital copies and derivatives, each available at a different URL. The same image might also be shown by a physical object, either by printing a digital file or that the digital image is a digitization of the physical object.

In order to accommodate these relationships, the model for digital objects echos the physical object / visual work distinction. In particular, digital images digitally_show a VisualItem. The different entities in the model can then have a Visual Item as a representation, meaning that the visual item depicts the entity in its content. As the image might have many different URLs from which it is available, it has an access_point property that lists those URLs.",Digital Integration,,,https://linked.art/example/person/15
51,Digital Surrogates,"Some digital representations are intended to be faithful reproductions of a physical object. Especially when digitizing two dimensional works, it is useful to distinguish between a digital image that depicts the object but perhaps along with other objects, people and the surroundings, compared to a digital image which shows only the same visual content as the physical object. The basic digital model and image model are the same as above, however we can be more explicit that the same visual item that the physical object shows is also digitally_shown_by the digital image.

These images are sometimes called ""Digital Surrogates"", as they can stand in for the physical object. A digital surrogate might show more than just the object, such as a color strip and a ruler, however the main focus of the visual item must clearly be the object itself. The line between surrogate and depiction is left to the policies and practices of the implementing organizations.",Digital Integration,Digital Images,,https://linked.art/example/object/30
52,Home Page,"Another very common scenario is that there is a web page about the object, perhaps managed by a collections management system. For humans, this page is much more useful than the data intended for machines. It can be referenced with the subject_of property, and points to a DigitalObject which is classified_as a web page, or aat:300264578. As with digital images, the home page can have a format of ""text/html"" and other properties.",Digital Integration,,,https://linked.art/example/object/31
53,Other Pages,"While the publishing organization might have a home page for their object as above, there are likely to be many other web pages about the object as well in different systems. These pages follow the same model of being a DigitalObject, but instead use the referred_to_by property for the link in the same manner as other texts.",Digital Integration,,,https://linked.art/example/object/32
54,IIIF Images,"The IIIF Image API is a DigitalService from which various derivatives of the image content can be requested. Similarly to the access_point property used in the previous sections, this service is referenced via the digitally_available_via property from the core DigitalObject that represents the digital image. The same image might have both access points and image services.

The IIIF Image service should have a conforms_to property that refers to ""http://iiif.io/api/image"" as the URI of an InformationObject, so that applications know what sort of service is being referred to.",Digital Integration,IIIF,,https://linked.art/example/object/33
55,IIIF Manifests,"The IIIF Presentation API is considered to be a DigitalObject that is about the object, in the same way as the home page of the object in a collection information system. The property used to refer to it from the object is, thus, subject_of. The conformsTo property should also be used with the Presentation API URI, and the Digital Object can also be given a format for JSON-LD.",Digital Integration,IIIF,,https://linked.art/example/object/34
56,Core Information,"All of the core information for resources is available for Place, including identifiers, classifications, labels, names, statements and so forth.

It is recommended that external gazeteer systems be used for recording the spatial hierarchy of Places, however it is still useful to be able to position historical locations within their larger geospatial context. This uses the same partitioning pattern as all other classes in the model.",Places,,,https://linked.art/example/place/2
57,Geospatial Location,"One of the expected user interface requirements for places is the ability to plot them on a map. In order to do this, or to calculate the geospatial overlap of places, it is useful to have a geometry that describes the place's boundaries in the real world. This could be very detailed, a simple bounding box within which the place fits, or a point close to the center of the area.

This is handled simply by associating a WKT string with the place using the defined_by property. A simple user interface for generating WKT representations is available from the Wicket Project.",Places,,,https://linked.art/example/place/3
58,Geospatial Approximation,"All recorded locations are approximate to some degree. It may be desirable to capture the exact location separately from a broader area that is known, especially when that approximation is very uncertain. If the place is the exact location of several events, and a name for the place is available but not exact geospatial coordinates or a full address, then this pattern is especially valuable. This is managed using the part_of construction -- the specific place is somewhere within the broader area.",Places,Geospatial Location,,https://linked.art/example/place/4
59,"Buildings and ""Immovable"" Objects","It is easy to confuse places with the constructions that exist at the place. While rare, there are situations when buildings are moved between locations. The building, just like a painting, is thus modeled as an object that has a current location in space. Activities take place in the place, rather than in the object. The granularity of the place compared to the building may be different due to underlying data management.

This applies to any other ""immovable"" object as well, such as large stellae through pyramids, ruins, or any other constructed object that might otherwise be ""permanently"" at a particular location.",Places,,,https://linked.art/example/object/75
60,Types,"There are two primary types of acting agent, Person and Group. Person is used for humans, and Group is used for any collective set of humans. Groups typically are able to take action as a coherent whole, but in some cases this is overlooked for simplicity's sake. For example, it is useful to be able to say that ""The Museum"" acquired a painting or ""The Workshop"" produced a sculpture, when in fact it was some subset of the members of the group that actually performed the activity but we do not know exactly who.

Person and Group are sub-classes of the Actor class, which might be used as a fallback when it is not known whether the actor is a Person or a Group. For example, if a sale of an object is listed as being from an art dealer called ""Smith"", it is unclear whether it refers to a person via their family name, or to an organization named after its owner. Equally, if there is no information about the actor currently available, but identity is desired such that it can later be reconciled or used because there is some other information known, then the use of Actor is likely needed in this case as well. This is only to be used when the nature of the actor is unknown to avoid asserting the existence of a Person when it might have been a Group, or vice versa.",Actors: People and Organizations,,,https://linked.art/example/person/2
61,Names,Names are described in detail in the shared patterns section.,Actors: People and Organizations,,,https://linked.art/example/person/3
62,Parts of Names,"Personal names can often be broken down into parts, with different types. The types are given using the classified_as property. The name parts are themselves Names, and are included in the part set in the same way as other partitioning. The type of name is given using classified_as, in the regular fashion. Western name division vocabulary is given below, and other name part types should be suggested
",Actors: People and Organizations,Names,,https://linked.art/example/person/4
63,Identity,"People and Organizations are often assigned identifiers that should be recorded and tracked in the same way as any other identity. These follow the same basic pattern as for other identifiers, with identified_by being used with an Identifier resource.",Actors: People and Organizations,,,https://linked.art/example/person/5 
64,Equivalent Resources,"There may be other identifiers for the person available in external systems, such as ULAN or any of a dozen others. If all of the information needed about the person is available from that system, then it is recommended to simply use that identifier directly as the URI for the Person. If there is a requirement to maintain separate information about the person, then the equivalent property should be used to align the two. This might happen when, for example, the local data has additional information about which documents refer to the person, or more detailed biographical information
",Actors: People and Organizations,Identity,,https://linked.art/example/person/6
65,Addresses,"People and Organizations often have addresses, physical or online, via which they can be contacted. This includes mailing addresses, email addresses and so forth. These are referenced separately from Names and Identifiers, as many Actors might have the same contact point. The address is an identifier for a location or service, and is thus modeled as an Identifier. This means it does not have language information, unlike Names, but addresses are not inherently linguistic.

This Identifier is then related to the actor via the contact_point property. They can be classified_as different types, and use the content property to capture the address itself.",Actors: People and Organizations,,,https://linked.art/example/person/7
66,Birth and Death / Formation and Dissolution,"Like the production of objects or the creation of texts, people and organizations also come into and out of existence through events. These events can take place at certain Places, and happen at certain times.

People are born in Birth events and die in Death events, related to the person by the born and died properties respectively. Groups are formed in Formation events, and dissolved in Dissolution events, referenced via the formed_by and dissolved_by properties. These classes are modeled not as Activities, but as Events that are not themselves carried out by anyone. They are the coming into existence instant of the person, not the conception of the couple, the labor of the mother, or potentially the killing by a murderer. These activities can be modeled as causes, as described below.

Birth and Death do not have any properties of their own that are used in the model, only those inherited from the event superclass, such as timespan and took_place_at.

!!! ""note"" ""Inanimate Thing or Dead Person?"" After death, people are still instances of Person which is a subclass of Actor, even though they can no longer carry out activities. People in comas or otherwise completely incapacitated also cannot carry out activities, but are not temporarily non-Actors. The modeling that death is a transformation from an instance of Person to an instance of Thing adds complexity for the sake of purity, but does not add any actual value. Thus a burial activity (aat:300263485) buries a Person, not a Thing-that-used-to-be-a-Person. However if the skeleton is then dug up and exhibited, it is exhibited as a Thing. There is, therefore, a transition at some undetermined point.",Actors: People and Organizations,Life Events,,"https://linked.art/example/person/8
https://linked.art/example/group/1 "
67,Active Dates,"It is often useful to know where and when the person or organization was active in their professional function. For example, an artist might have started painting when they were 20, stopped by 30, and only painted in Italy. This information can be used to help eliminate dubious attributions, for example.

The property for the Person or Group is carried_out, the inverse of the more familiar carried_out_by from Activities to Actors. The Activity resource should be classified_as aat:300393177, meaning the time when the actor is actively performing their primary professional function. The other properties of activities can and should also be used.",Actors: People and Organizations,Life Events,,https://linked.art/example/person/9
68,Biography,"Biographical descriptions follow the LinguisticObject pattern, with biography (aat:300080102) as the classification. In all other respects, it is a vanilla usage of a resource being referred_to_by a particular text.",Actors: People and Organizations,Descriptive Information,,https://linked.art/example/person/10
69,Nationality,"Nationality is modeled as a Type that is associated with the Person, rather than as a Group as described in the CIDOC-CRM ontology document. This is because all of the people, across all time, who have had a particular nationality, cannot take action as a single coherent entity. As Group is a sub-class of Actor, it is not thought to be an appropriate class for this use. Without proliferating new classes (e.g. sets of people that are not actors), the traditional and perfectly consistent way to describe nationality is as a flag on the person, which is modeled as a Type.

The Type resource should have aat:300379842 as one of its classifications, such that a consuming application can find all of the nationality types from amongst the person's classifications. The nationality resource should either be from an established vocabulary of nationalities, or have an exact_match to an established vocabulary entry if additional local information is necessary to record, such as a particular name for that nationality.",Actors: People and Organizations,Descriptive Information,,https://linked.art/example/person/11
70,Ethnicity,"Ethnicity is separate from nationality, as it refers to a social group or culture as opposed to a political nation or state. The same rationale as for Nationality being a classification also applies to ethnicity or culture -- it is unlikely to be a coherent collective capable of intentional action.",Actors: People and Organizations,Descriptive Information,,
71,Gender,"Gender is a debated and politically charged topic. The intent of this section is not to take a stand on those debates, but instead to allow the representation of data in museum and other information management systems to be made accessible.

Gender is not specifically discussed in CRM, in fact it was even deleted from a previous version, and the modeling follows the same classification pattern as for nationality and culture. This allows a plethora of gender diversity, and does not make any specific statements about biological versus assumed versus preferred gender roles. The gender must be classified_as aat:300055147.",Actors: People and Organizations,Descriptive Information,,https://linked.art/example/person/12
72,Digital Integration,"Images of the person can also be provided, following the common pattern for digital resources. Only the basic image case is shown below, the other scenarios can easily be determined from the referenced digital integration for objects.",Actors: People and Organizations,Descriptive Information,,https://linked.art/example/person/13
73,Organization Membership,"As discussed above, Organizations can be seen as the actor when it comes to their roles in various events. For example, an auction is likely to be carried out by an organization, and they can own and curate objects.

The only significantly new aspect to organizational actors, compared to people, is that they can have members. These members can be either sub-groups, such as a department within a museum, or individuals.",Actors: People and Organizations,,,https://linked.art/example/person/14
74,Provenance Event,"Provenance Events are wrapper activities which represent the context in which several more granular events occur, and represent the overall event that is tracked in the chain, rather than the specific legal and physical changes that affect one or more objects. For example, an exchange of one object for another is a single provenance entry that involves the transfer of ownership of the two objects and thus that event would appear in both objects' timelines. It might also be accompanied by an additional payment of money, promise of an activity or other contributions.

Provenance Events have all of the regular properties and relationships, as documented in the baseline patterns. In particular, the relationships to actors, places and time reflect the overall event, and can be further specified in the separate parts if they are different and known.","Object Provenance
",,,https://linked.art/example/provenance/4
75,Classifications,"There are many different types of provenance activity that can be covered with this model, from simple purchases to exchange money for an object, or more complex endowments, promised gifts, bequeathments and so forth. These classifications should be added to the activity to clarify the particular event.",Object Provenance,Provenance Event,,https://linked.art/example/provenance/5
76,Relative Times,"When describing historical events, it may not be possible to give any useful timespan of when the activity occured, and only be able to relate it to happening before or after another event. This allows the activity to be ordered in a chain of events, without being explicit about any date range.

The provenance activity has two properties to cover this situation, starts_after_the_end_of and ends_before_the_start_of. The first relates to activities that occur before the current event (the start of the current event is after the end of the previous one) and the latter relates to activities that occur after the current one, by the same logic.",Object Provenance,Provenance Event,,https://linked.art/example/provenance/6
77,"Object Acquisition
","Acquisitions are used to describe the transfer of ownership of an object from one owner to the next. The first owner is typically the artist, who would then transfer it to the second owner, to the third owner and so on. The ownership chain can be expressed by repeating this same pattern with the buyer from one acquisition being the seller in the subsequent one. If the previous owner (e.g. the seller if there is a value exchange) or the subsequent owner (e.g. the buyer) is not known for a particular acquisition, then the reference can be left out from the description.

The acquistion is not necessarily a purchase, it could be a gift, an inheritance or any other method of gaining the right of ownership of an object.

The model encodes this information with an Acquisition part of the overall Provenance Event. The acquisition is the transfer of the right of ownership of an object (referenced in transferred_title_of) from the seller (in transferred_title_from) to the buyer (in transferred_title_to).

Each object has its own Acquisition as part of the provenance event, so if a collector buys three paintings from a dealer, then there would be a single Provenance Event with three Acquisitions, all of which transfer the title of a single painting from the dealer to the collector.",Object Provenance,Parts,Object Acquisition and Loan,https://linked.art/example/provenance/7
78,"Multiple Owners
","In the simple case of multiple simultaneous owners where either the division of the ownership is unknown or an even split, all of the owners can simply be listed with transferred_title_from (when the group is selling) or transferred_title_to (when the group is buying).

If there is additional information known about the exact nature of the ownership division, then it is worth considering the more complex and more expressive section on rights to describe this in more detail.

If there are multiple parties that have formally entered into a legal consortium or organization, and that consortium is the legal owner of the object, then the consortium should be modeled as a Group with the parties as members, and be the sole owner of the object.",Object Provenance,Parts,Object Acquisition and Loan,https://linked.art/example/provenance/8
79,Agents,"In some cases, it is known that an agent other than the buyer carried out the acquisition. This can be modeled by associating a different actor from the buyer (the person who title is transferred to) carrying out the activity.",Object Provenance,Parts,Object Acquisition and Loan,https://linked.art/example/provenance/9
80,Exchange of Objects,This pattern allows for the exchange of objects between two parties by simply adding a second Acquisition.,Object Provenance,Parts,Object Acquisition and Loan,https://linked.art/example/provenance/10
81,Payments,"A purchase is a common type of acquisition in which money is exchanged for the object. The provenance event consists of the acquisition along with one or more related payments. This typically involves a payment from the seller to the buyer for the agreed upon price, but might include further payments to or from others such as for shared ownership, payment of debts owed, or for services rendered as part of the overall activity.

The Payment activity has equivalent relationships for the actor that the money is transferred from (paid_from), the actor the money is transferred to (paid_to), and the amount of money paid (paid_amount). The amount itself is a MonetaryAmount that has a value (value) and a currency (currency). Each separable monetary amount is modeled as an individual instance of Payment, and thus if the buyer paid a commission to the agent who carried out the purchase, and paid for the object, then there would be two Payments, one from the buyer to the seller and one from the buyer to the agent. Commissions to auction houses or for consignments would use the same pattern.",Object Provenance,Parts,Object Acquisition and Loan,https://linked.art/example/provenance/11
82,"Payment for Services
","Beyond simply paying the previous owner for the object, there are many other reasons why money might change hands that are relevant to describe for art history.

For example, it might be known how much commission went to an auction house or for the sale of objects by consignment, particularly if this comes from the stock books or records of the company. Artists might be paid a commission in advance for the production of an object, or agents might be paid a commission for finding and purchasing objects on behalf of the new owner.",Object Provenance,Parts,Object Acquisition and Loan,https://linked.art/example/provenance/12
83,Loans,"The model makes a distinction between the transfer of legal ownership and the transfer of custody of an object (e.g. by losing the object or loaning it out for an exhibition). If the possession of the object is temporary, such that the object would be given back to the real owner at the end of that possession without what might be considered a sale or exchange, then it is a transfer of custody. Note that the provenance activity here does not represent the entire duration of the change in custody, only the transfer of it. Just like acquisitions, there would be a second provenance activity that would transfer the custody back to the original custodian or on to some other party.

Long term loans or even ""permanent"" loans are just open ended pairs of activities -- the object has had its custody transferred, and the object has not been returned yet.

In the model, these transfers of custody use a different class, TransferOfCustody instead of Acquisition. The properties that capture the parties and object involved are also different, although equivalent, to those of Acquisition: transferred_custody_of the object, transferred_custody_from the previous custodian, and transferred_custody_to the new custodian.",Object Provenance,Parts,"Loans, Thefts, Losses and other Changes of Custody","https://linked.art/example/provenance/16
https://linked.art/example/provenance/17"
84,"Institutional Ownership, Departmental Custody","Objects are owned by legal entities, such as museum organizations or individual people. However there may be more information about which department is responsible within a museum for the curation of the object. This is the division between acquisitions (the legal ownership of the object) and custody (the responsibility for looking after the object). If the department is known, then it should be either part of the Provenance Event in which the object is acquired, or a separate provenance event if the object was not accessioned by a department and later came under their care, or was transferred between departments. In these latter cases, the ownership does not change, only the custody of the object.

The department becomes the current_keeper of the object, whereas the institution is the current_owner, as described in the object section. The transfer model is otherwise identical to other transfers of custody.",Object Provenance,Parts,"Loans, Thefts, Losses and other Changes of Custody",https://linked.art/example/provenance/18
85,Loss,"The loss of an object is the transfer of custody away from its current owner, without stating a recipient. In the future, if the object is discovered, the recipient might be able to be filled in. If the object is then returned to the owner, there would be the reverse transfer of custody from the party that found it. It might be that the owner simply loses track of it, and although it is still in their possession, they are not aware of it ... it has no custodian, but it has not moved and the owner still owns it.",Object Provenance,Parts,"Loans, Thefts, Losses and other Changes of Custody",https://linked.art/example/provenance/19
86,Theft,"The theft of an object is also the (illegal) transfer of custody of the object, rather than a transfer of ownership. If the stolen object were recovered, then it would be restored to its owner. Stolen, or looted as a special case of theft, objects and their repatriation are an interesting and important part of the provenance of a work and frequently contested.

A single theft event might involve stealing multiple objects, in the same way that the purchase of an auction lot might involve the acquisition of multiple objects for a combined payment.",Object Provenance,Parts,"Loans, Thefts, Losses and other Changes of Custody",https://linked.art/example/provenance/20
87,Sale of Stolen or Looted Objects,"If a stolen object is sold, then that purchase is actually just a transfer of custody in exchange for money (or other payment). Typically, of course, the nature of that transaction is not discovered until long after the fact. This can then have many effects on the provenance record for the object as suddenly many acquisitions would be retroactively changed to being transfers of custody. This updating of the historical record is necessary without going to great lengths to model the belief that an acquisition is legal for the vast majority of cases when it is, indeed, legal in order to allow that belief to be incorrect for the few times when it is not.",Object Provenance,Parts,"Loans, Thefts, Losses and other Changes of Custody",https://linked.art/example/provenance/21
88,Rights and their Acquisition,"The model for acquiring an object (by purchase, gift or other means) incorporates the specific right of ownership into the properties of the Acquisition resource. The acquisition transfers the title of the object between parties, but that ""title"" could be expanded to a more completely modeled Right. For some scenarios where we have more information about the interactions and legal status, we need to explicitly model these rights.

Rights are conceptual things that apply to their real world subjects. They are not relative to time, but can be established and invalidated by various activities or events. The simplest case would be that as part of the provenance event where an object is acquired, there is also the establishment of the right of ownership of that object by the new owner and the invalidation of the right of ownership of the previous owner.

While it is possible and valid to have both the Acquisition and the Right in a single provenance entry, it is redundant as the acquisition model is simpler and more concise without losing any information. The sections below introduce scenarios in which information would be lost without the explicit modeling of the Right.

In order to connect the Right to the provenance activity, we introduce a new Activity subclass called RightAcquistion. It has two new properties: establishes links the Right that was established by this activity, and invalidates can optionally link to the Right that was rendered invalid by the activity.

Instances of Right have two properties: possessed_by refers to the actor (Group or Person) that has the right described, and applies_to refers to the thing over which the right pertains.",Object Provenance,Parts,Transfer of Rights,https://linked.art/example/provenance/27
89,Multiple Owners with Different Stakes,"A change in ownership might involve more than two parties, resulting in a state where multiple actors together own some share of the object. Examples of this situation include when art dealers share the costs of purchasing an object and then share the proceeds of sale in the same proportions, when a donor gives part of the value of an object to an institution, or when a marriage is dissolved and the value of the object is split between the individuals.

The base acquisition model allows for ownership to be transferred to multiple actors, but it is impossible to then determine the share of the value that was owned by each party and the implicit assumption should be that all parties owned equal shares. In order to allow for the description of different proportions of the object to be owned by different actors, we need partition the Right into shares to be divided. These components are themselves Rights that are possessed by the respective parties.

In the same way as describing the physical extent of a physical object, we can use a Dimension to describe the logical extent of the ownership. At any given time the total shares of an object should, of course, add up to the entire object. If this is not true, then it might signify either that the accounting is wrong (more than 100% of the object is claimed as being owned), theft (multiple claims of ownership at the same time, some of which are illegal), or just that it is now unknown what happened.",Object Provenance,Parts,Transfer of Rights,https://linked.art/example/provenance/28
90,Transfer of Shares,"Once the share of an object has been established, that right can be traded as part of future provenance entries.

In order to maintain consistency with the original establishment of the division of ownership, the difference between the initial state and the new state is not described, but instead the new state is described directly. If a 10% share is acquired from another owner, the 10% is not traded requiring the system to calculate the new total proportions, but instead the new total proportions are described.

If only existing owners are part of the entry, then there is no need to establish a new Right that is the new total ownership, it is simply a new division of the existing total. Ownership Rights are brought into existence by Acquisition events - the set of people who possess the right is fixed, and is the same set of actors as those referenced by title_transferred_to. Thus any new Acquisition by a new partial owner requires a new Ownership Right, as described above.",Object Provenance,Parts,Transfer of Rights,https://linked.art/example/provenance/29
91,Intellectual Property Rights,"Other sorts of rights associated with art that can be acquired include the intellectual property rights, such as copyright for a text or image, separate from any physical carrier, or the right to perform some piece of time-based media such as a projected installation. The manipulation of these rights also uses the RightAcquisition pattern.

Many copyrights for images are owned by collective organizations rather than individuals, and these organizations can acquire and exchange those copyrights completely independently of any physical carrier of the image.",Object Provenance,Parts,Transfer of Rights,https://linked.art/example/provenance/30
92,Encounters,"Objects of cultural significance are often lost to all knowledge, or to the general knowledge of the prevailing culture, and then later rediscovered. This is considered to be part of the provenance of the object, rather than equivalent to its Production, especially as both may be known. There are also ownership considerations that need to be taken into account at the same time, as to whether this find also transfers the ownership of the object to the discoverer, or merely custody of it.

The model uses an Encounter activity, which is carried out by the person or group making the rediscovery. The activity has its own relationship for the object that is rediscovered, encountered, to ensure that other objects that are used as part of the discovery can be separated from the ""find"". As it is part of a Provenance Event, other parts can describe the changing ownership status of the object. In all other ways, the Encounter is just like a regular Activity as described in the baseline patterns.",Object Provenance,Parts,Encounters with Objects,https://linked.art/example/provenance/22
93,Promised Gift,"A promise of a gift (or sale, or exchange) is an Activity which is carried out by the promising party. It is a promise to some other actor to perform some further activity (the acquisition), however we lack the ontological machinery at the moment to make this explicit. Instead we can reference the promised party and the object being promised only via the more general properties of participant and used_specific_object respectively.

Further details and clarification about the promise, including any description of the contract, should be given in a descriptive note on the promise activity.",Object Provenance,Parts,Promised Activities,https://linked.art/example/provenance/24
94,Commissions for Artwork,"Another type of promise can occur even before the artwork is produced: a commission from a sponsor for the production of the work. This starts out with paired promises, where the artist promises to produce the work, and the commissioner promises to pay for it. There might be some amount of money paid to the artist in advance, or other transfers of custody or ownership of objects, such as lending something to the artist to produce a copy of. Given the potential for multiple exchanges of promises, money, and objects, the description of the commissioning activity fits cleanly into the broader Provenance Entry model.

The description of the production of the commissioned object is taken care of by the regular production pattern, as described in the object section. The subsequent transfer of title to the new owner, and the payment of any monies due to the artist is a second provenance entry following all of the regular patterns.",Object Provenance,Parts,Promised Activities,"https://linked.art/example/provenance/25 
https://linked.art/example/object/76"
95,Auction,"The auction is the overall event, and a typical auction has the features described here. The auction might occur over multiple days, during which many auction of lots (the sale of one or more objects) will take place. It is performed by an organization, known as an auction house, and for movable art objects takes place at the premises of the organization. The auction of lot is each a separate sale, described in the following section.

The auction is modeled as an Activity, and represents the overall event. It is carried_out_by the auction house (a Group), took_place_at the auction house premises (a Place), and has all of the regular properties of an Activity. It is referenced by the auction of lot activities via their part_of property.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,https://linked.art/example/event/6
96,Auction of Lot,"The auction of a lot is an activity with an aim of obtaining the highest price for object or objects available in that lot. It is normally carried out by an auctioneer employed by the auction house organization. The price increases as people make bids, and the highest bidder is the winner of the auction. The details of the individual bids are not normally known, however whether there were bids but no sale is sometimes available. The auction of lot then causes the Provenance activity that describes the purchase, with the transfer of ownership, custody and payments.

The model uses an Activity for the auction of lot, which is part_of the Auction event. It uses a Set of objects to link the objects for sale to the activity via the used_specific_object property. Any bidding information is part of the the Auction of Lot, and if the reserve price is met, then a provenance entry representing the purchase of the objects is caused by the Auction of Lot. It can also have all of the regular activity properties to refer to time and place.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,https://linked.art/example/event/7
97,Known Bid Amounts,"Sometimes we also know the monetary amounts that were unsuccessfully bid for the object, regardless of whether the auction eventually ended in a sale or not. These bids are part of the overall bidding activity.

Bids are modeled as the creation of a proposition that the bidder (or the person that an agent is bidding on behalf of) will pay a certain amount of money for the object. In the example below, a known bid is $10,000 but it is not stated whether there was a sale concluded.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,https://linked.art/example/event/8
98,Set of Objects,"The Lot is a set of objects grouped together for the purposes of the sale, and may potentially have come from different owners. It is frequently assigned an identifying Lot Number by the auction house, and may have a title, description or other properties such as specific price information, discussed in more detail below. The set has members which are the objects for sale.
",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,https://linked.art/example/set/6
99,Pre-set Prices,"In auctions, there are several types of monetary values that are useful and interesting to record. There is a significant distinction between the starting price or reserve price for an auction and the regular purchase price of an object, in that even if the auction never takes place, these other prices are still known as they are set in advance.

There are three pre-set prices of interest:

Starting Price: (aat:300417242) The price at which the auction will start.
Reserve Price: (aat:300417243) The price that must be exceeded for the auction to result in a sale.
Estimated Price: (aat:300417244) The price that the auction house estimates will be the final sale price.
These prices are associated with the Set of Objects that the Auction of Lot is intended to sell. In this way, even if the auction never takes place, there is still the set of objects to associate the prices with. In order to associate a monetary value with an object, it is treated as an observed dimension.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,https://linked.art/example/set/7
100,Purchase of Lot,"The purchase of the lot is very similar to the purchase of any other object, however there is an explicit reference to the set of objects. The set is only a temporary grouping, put together only for the purpose of this particular auction and is not something which can be owned directly. As such, each object has its own acquisition as part of the provenance event. Conversely, there is only a single payment for the entire lot.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,https://linked.art/example/provenance/13
101,Lot Withdrawn,"It is possible that an auction lot is withdrawn from the auction before the auction of lot occurs. The auction catalog will record the objects in the lot, and is valuable for the historical record to know that they were offered for sale and then withdrawn.

In this case, there should be a catalog entry and the auction lot set that the entry describes, but no corresponding auction of lot activity, as it did not take place. The date can be calculated from the dates of the auction event, to position the objects in time. In some cases, where the auctioned objects are all from a single person or organization, this would also establish evidence of ownership at that time.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,
102,Object Withdrawn from Lot,"It can also be that a single object is withdrawn from a Lot with multiple objects, which is otherwise sold. In this case, the withdrawn object is returned to the owner as part of the provenance event that is caused by the auction of the lot which still takes place. That return has a specific purpose that can distinguish withdrawn objects from objects that are returned for other reasons below.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,
103,Reserve Not Met,"Another scenario is when the auction of lot does take place, but there is no purchase because a reserve price was not met. This is often referred to as being ""Bought In"", or sometimes ""Passed"".

In this case the auction of lot activity does occur, but there may or may not have been any bidding. It does result in a provenance entry, as for the auction house organization to be able to auction it, they must have had some degree of custody of the object. There may also be a commission paid from the owner to the auction house for running the auction, even though it was ultimately unsuccessful.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,https://linked.art/example/provenance/14
104,Bought by Owner,"In some cases the owner of the object actively bids on their own items, either directly or via an agent, and ends up bidding the highest amount, and thereby winning the lot. This is different to the bought in case, as in that case the reserve was not met, and in this case it was. This was sometimes done intentionally to determine what the market would bear for an object, or to drive up the price of related objects by providing a precedent.

As the owner cannot sell the object to themselves, this does not result in a change of ownership. In the same way as when the reserve is not met, there is a change of custody from the owner to the auction house and back again, and might involve paying commission to the auction house for the ""sale"". Conversely, in this case we do know that there was bidding as there was a ""sale"", even if there was not a transfer of ownership.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,
105,"Winner Unable to Pay
","And in other cases, someone successfully wins the auction other than the owner, but is unable to pay. In this case there was a bid, the promise to pay a given amount, but no subsequent fulfillment of the promise with a payment. Again, this results in the transfer of custody of the object from the auction house back to the owner. The bid amount can be recorded as described in the bidding section.

It is not often to know that this has occured, unless the information is coming either directly from the auction house or from the owner. This might happen when an art dealer auctions an object, and then records the return of the object in their stock management system.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,
106,Auction Catalog,"Much of the information we have about historical auctions comes from Auction Catalogs. These documents thus provide the primary source of evidence, and can be linked to the descriptions of the activities. These follow the same model as other documents.",Object Provenance,Parts,Auctions,https://linked.art/example/text/10
107,Moving an Object,"The model for moving an object is very similar to that of an Acquisition, Transfer of Custody or Payment. There is an activity, which can be carried_out_by an actor and all of the other basic activity features, that moved the object between two locations, from the place given in moved_from and to the place given in moved_to.",Object Provenance,Parts,Object Location and Movement,https://linked.art/example/provenance/23
108,Taking Inventory,"One such activity is taking inventory (aat:300077506) by the owner of their objects. This is routinely carried out by art dealers, collectors or museums, in order to ensure that they still have custody of all of the objects that they believe they do. This establishes the existence and presence of the object at a certain place and time, and is thus useful in tracking the object through history.

This is modeled as an Encounter. In this case, the actor knows where the object is and it is not a ""discovery"", and the Provenance Activity describes the activity of the owner recording that they have seen the object, and perhaps inspected or examined it. The object itself does not change, nor its ownership or custody, but this is more that the knowledge of the state of the object is verified or updated.",Object Provenance,Parts,Object Curation,https://linked.art/example/provenance/15
109,Object Ownership and Existence,"There isn't a temporal entity in the model that represents the entire duration of ownership of an object by a Person or Group, nor a temporal entity that represents the entire existence of an object. This is useful for the simple cases, when an object is acquired and sold individually, however quickly becomes complicated when multiple objects are involved in a single transaction. Instead, the relative temporal ordering properties of starts_after_the_end_of and ends_before_the_start_of are recommended to chain Provenance Activities together, allowing a system to infer the periods between the events.
",Object Provenance,Parts,Object Curation,
110,Core Features,"Sets are conceptual groupings, rather than physical ones. The set of objects in a virtual exhibition or simply the set of a person's favorite objects never change their physical state by being part of the Set or not. They are, thus, created by a Creation, not by a Production.

Like any core resource, Set must have an id and type, are likely to have additional classifications, and can have Identifiers and Names. They can have statements made about them, and have member resources. These member resources are included via the member property rather than part, or via member_of from the included resource to the Set.",Collections and Sets,Sets,,https://linked.art/example/set/3
111,Collections of Objects,"Sets can be used to describe the set of objects that make up a curated collection. This is not necessarily the set of objects that the institution owns, as there could be objects which are looked after but owned by some other organization or individual, nor the set of objects that the institution has custody over, as objects being loaned to other organizations for exhibitions are still part of the conceptual collection of objects. The details of the relationship between the object and the institution are recorded on the object, and the Set simply records which objects are thought of as being part of the collection. Objects can be thought of as being part of multiple collections at the same time -- the private owner's personal collection and the museum's public collection. So while the majority of objects are both owned by and in the custody of the organization, this is not certain and should not be inferred. The Set is created by the organization or person that abstractly manages the collected objects.

This pattern can be used for any type of organization that manages objects, from museums and archives to individuals and art dealers.",Collections and Sets,Sets,,https://linked.art/example/set/4
112,Departmental Collections,"Institutions are often split up into departments, each of which will manage a part of the overall collection. These parts of the collection are managed as separate Sets, rather than a tree structure within a single resource. It is useful to be able to describe the properties of the object in each of the contexts, and allow a separate structure of inventory management from organizational chart. The department might also conceive of further sets of their objects, without any direct correspondence and likely with the same object being part of more than one set at the same time.
",Collections and Sets,Sets,Collections of Objects,https://linked.art/example/set/5
113,Other Uses,"The set of objects in an auction lot are also modeled as a Set. These are not curated in the same way as a museum collection, and are not necessarily ever brought together physically, but are being put up for auction as a single entity. Similarly, the set of objects used in an exhibition is also modeled as a Set.",Collections and Sets,Sets,,
114,Collection Specific Information,"Information about a resource that is specific to the context of the set that they are part of, such as the accession number of an object for that particular collection, can be described using the AttributeAssignment patterns described in the page about assertions.",Collections and Sets,Sets,,
115,Adding and Removing Resources,"Objects are rarely added and removed from collections without further contextual information, there is almost always some larger activity that results in the change. The ownership of the object is transferred to the organization which prompts it to be accessioned into the collection, and subsequently an accession number Identifier as assigned to it.

There are two activities, Addition and Removal, which mirror the same activities of Joining and Leaving for members of Groups. These may be included in the object representation, to further expand upon the member_of relationship.",Collections and Sets,Collections over Time,,https://linked.art/example/object/29
116,Exhibition Concept,"The model distinguishes between the concept of the exhibition and the activity that makes that concept real. The concept is created by the people who originally think up the exhibition, long before any of the pieces are collected together. The exhibition concept likely has some theme that results in a coherent set of objects being presented, which could be as complex as post-industrial life or as simple as the life's work of a particular artist.

The concept is modeled as a PropositionalObject, and classified_as aat:300417531 to ensure that it's clearly tagged as an exhibition. It can have all of the affordances of any concept, such as names, identifiers, references, relationships and more.",Exhibitions,,,https://linked.art/example/concept/2
117,Exhibition Activity,"There is an activity, as described in the section on Provenance, which is the exhibiting of the objects. In particular, the public exhibition takes place at a certain time given in timespan, at a certain place or places given in took_place_at, and was organized by some actor or actors, likely organizations, given in carried_out_by. It can be recognized as an exhibition using the classification of aat:300054766, ""exhibitions"".",Exhibitions,,,https://linked.art/example/activity/1
118,Multiple Venues,"Some exhibitions are shown at different locations over time, moving from one museum or exhibition hall to another. In this case, each of the different locations is treated as an exhibition in its own right, and then a broader ""travelling exhibition"" (aat:300054773) is created that these are part of. Note that the travelling exhibition can have separate properties from its parts, such as a label to distinguish the joint nature and a broader timespan that covers all of the venues. There is no need to duplicate the organizations and locations in the travelling exhibition, these can be determined more easily by looking at the exhibitions that it consists of.
",Exhibitions,,,https://linked.art/example/event/5
119,Objects,"The collection of art objects on display at exhibitions can be listed from the Exhibition with the property used_specific_object. The model for the set of objects that make up the content of the exhibition is the same as the model for permanent collections -- the objects are collected together into a Set, which is used by the Exhibition.

For the travelling exhibitions described above, a different collection of objects should be referenced from each of the venues. Objects are frequently added or removed for the venue, and each venue will likely have its own context specific information such as descriptions or labels. The top level activity representing the overall exhibition does not have its own Aggregation in the travelling exhibition case.",Exhibitions,,,https://linked.art/example/activity/2
120,Exhibition Provenance: Transfer of Custody,"As objects used for exhibitions frequently come from many different organizations, it is useful and interesting to track the custody of the object as well as the ownership. This TransferOfCustody event is modeled in the same way as other Provenance changes.

For each exhibition, the custody of the object is transferred from the previous custodian to the next. In the simple case of a single venue for the exhibition, the first transfer is likely to be from the owner to the organization responsible for the exhibition, and then at the end of the exhibition, the custody is transferred back again. In a more complex scenario with multiple venues, each organization hosting the exhibition will likely transfer custody to the next in the sequence. Unlike regular provenance transfers, these happen for a specific purpose ... the exhibition. This is added to the model with the specific_purpose property.",Exhibitions,Objects,,https://linked.art/example/provenance/2
121,Exhibition Provenance: Internal Moves,"Conversely to the previous section, when the object being exhibited at the location is owned by the same organization, there is no transfer of custody. The equivalent activity is likely to be simply moving the object from its regular location to the exhibition space. If the exhibition location is not known, then there is no need to provide the moved_to and moved_from relationships for the Move activity.
",Exhibitions,Objects,,https://linked.art/example/provenance/3
122,Exhibition Specific Labels,"The curators for exhibitions sometimes assign new labels or names for objects, for example to ensure that they follow an established pattern for the exhibition, rather than following that of the owning organization or person, if any. This activity of assigning a title to the object is part of the exhibition via the part property, and assigns a new Name to the object. This separation of the name from the object via the AttributeAssignment ensures that the Name does not directly end up in the set of titles for the object without further intervention. As with any activity, the assignment can also be carried_out_by an actor, and have a timespan for when it was assigned. This is an instance of the Context Specific Assertions pattern.

",Exhibitions,Objects,,
123,Depiction of the Object at the Exhibition,"There are often photographs of the object as displayed in the exhibition. These are representations of the object regardless, and hence can be associated directly with the object rather than via an AttributeAssignment. The description of the image therefore follows the same pattern as other digital representations of the object, but like the label example above, it occurred as part of the exhibition.

The same pattern of having the creation of the image as part of the exhibition activity does not suffice, as the image could be a digital reproduction of physical photograph, created much later than the exhibition. Secondly, the creation of the photograph was very likely not carried out as part of carrying out the exhibition by the museum, it could easily have been taken by a visitor.",Exhibitions,Objects,,
124,"Physical Objects, Conceptual Texts","The first distinction that is needed is between the physical carrier of the text, and the text itself. Like the VisualItem pattern for the artwork's visual content shown by objects, the LinguisticObject that represents the text of a work can be carried by many HumanMadeObjects. In this way, all of the copies of a particular book carry the same information content, that only needs to be described once and can act as a single connection point.

Like other LinguisticObjects, it can have a value for the actual text of the work, classifications, languages and so forth.",Texts and Documents,,,https://linked.art/example/object/35
125,Core Features,"The same core features of all other resources are also applicable to the LinguisticObjects used to represent texts. They must have an id and type, they should have a label, they should have a classified_as relationship to a Type that further describes the sort of object, and so forth. They may also have a language property, that references a Language resource.

The title of a text is captured using the Name pattern, and assigned identifiers using the Identifier pattern, referenced with the identified_by relationship.",Texts and Documents,,,https://linked.art/example/text/1
126,Creation and Publication,"The production of the physical carriers of texts uses the same model as for other physical objects, and may be of interest for manuscripts, very early printed works (incunabula), letters or other similar documents, however the factory details for a specific modern book are likely of much less importance to capture.

There are two primary text-specific activities that are captured -- the creation of the text, being the conceptual LinguisticObject and its publication. The text is created by a Creation activity of the author, but then there is a publishing Activity (aat:300054686) carried out by the publishing organization, for the same resource.",Texts and Documents,,,https://linked.art/example/text/2
127,Structure,"The textual structure can be modeled with the partitioning of LinguisticObjects via the part_of property, in the same way that the parts of a physical object can be partitioned. Thus the content of an Article can be part of the containing Issue, which is part of a Volume, which is part of the Journal or other periodical. Similarly Chapters can be part of a Book or Proceedings, particular entries within a catalog, and so forth.
",Texts and Documents,,,https://linked.art/example/text/3
128,"Pagination Statement
",The easiest way to describe the page range of a particular section of a larger collection is with a pagination statement. The disadvantage of the approach is that it is not computationally available for processing.,Texts and Documents,Pages,,https://linked.art/example/text/4
129,Abstracts,"While the full text of the LinguisticObject may be either too long to provide, or protected by publication and access restrictions, it is common for an abstract to be published and circulated openly. This abstract might be provided by some other actor than the author of the content, such as via an abstracting and indexing service. In this case, the Abstract would have its own separate Creation activity from that of the abstracted content.",Texts and Documents,,,https://linked.art/example/text/5
130,References to other Resources,"Textual content can refer_to other resources in the overall model. These references might be just that the content discusses the resource, such as a mention of a particular painting. Equally, the reference might be that the content was used as the evidence for the resource, such as a Materials Statement being the evidence for the Materials in the model that the painting is asserted to be made_of.",Texts and Documents,,,https://linked.art/example/text/6
131,Translations ,"One Linguistic Object, be it captured in the model as a Statement or as the full text content carried by a physical object, can be the translation of another. For example an article can be the translation of an original article in a different language. This is represented using the translation_of relationship.",Texts and Documents,,,https://linked.art/example/text/7
132,Assignment of Attributes,"The AttributeAssignment class is an Activity, carried out by curators or researchers rather than by artists or collectors, that assigns information to resources in the model. This can be used to assign any property or relationship on any resource that can be the subject of such a property. The general Activity properties of carried_out_by, timespan and took_place_at are available for when and where the assignment happened, and who made it. The timespan is the moment when the assignment took place, rather than the length of time that the assignment was held to be true by some audience.

This pattern is useful when you do not want to assert the relationship directly, such as for a name that was previously given to the object but is no longer actively used. Or an attribution of an artist that is possibly true, but might only be an informed guess.

The value of the assignment is given using assigned, and it can be any resource or value. The resource that the value is assigned to is given using the attributed_by property on that resource, and the relationship between them is given using assigned_property. Thus an AttributeAssignment can assign an Actor to a Production with the carried_out_by relationship, or a Name to an Actor with the identified_by relationship. In terms of the relationship that the AttributeAssignment expresses, the resource with the attributed_by property is the subject of the relationship, the relationship itself is given in assigned_property, and the object of the relationship is given in assigned, thereby making up a regular 'triple' of subject, predicate, object.",Previously-Held or Context-Specific Assertions,,,https://linked.art/example/object/19
133,Assigned Value as Resource,"In other situations the assigned value is the appropriate resource with which to associate the AttributeAssignment. In this case we flip the AttributeAssignment around and use assigned_by on the value of the assignment (the object of the relationship), and do not specify the subject of the relationship as it's the resource which refers to the value. For example, it is very useful to be able to assert which organization created and assigned an identifier to an object of a given type in order to disambiguate that organization's identifier from another organization's identifier of the same type, such as accession numbers. Another use case is giving further information about a particular Dimension associated with the object, such as who measured it, when, with which instrument, and so on.

In this case, the subject of the relationship is the resource which refers to the value, the predicate is that relationship, and the object is the resource with the assigned_by property which refers to the AttributeAssignment.",Previously-Held or Context-Specific Assertions,Assignment of Attributes,,https://linked.art/example/object/20
134,"""Style Of"" Attribution","There is a common special case of wanting to assign not an individual (e.g. Rembrandt) or a group with specific identity (Workshop of Rembrandt) to the production of an object, but simply to say that it was produced as if it had been produced by some other actor. This is traditionally recorded as being ""in the style of"" or ""in the manner of"" a known artist. It is not correct to say that Rembrandt carried out the production, but a search for objects attributed (loosely speaking) to Rembrandt should discover this object. The assessment of ""style of"" attribution is a judgement decision that might be changed later as new evidence of the actual creator comes to light.

The approach taken for this case is to use an AttributeAssignment that associates a Production activity that is influenced_by the artist and classified_as being in the ""style of"" (aat:300404285). This prevent systems from mistakenly infering that the actor carried_out the production, but is consistent with the overall pattern.

This would also apply to cases where there is a ""circle of"" or ""follower of"" and similar attributions in which there is doubt that there was an actual coherent group, and thus there is reluctance to give that hypothetical group an identity. Instead of using the ""style of"" AAT concept, it would use another attribution qualifiers.",Previously-Held or Context-Specific Assertions,Assignment of Attributes,,
135,Context Specific Assertions,"The basic pattern for making an assertion within some context is to reuse the AttributeAssignment activity, and have it be part of some larger activity. A good example of this is the assignment of a particular title to a work during an Exhibition. This could equally be part of the larger cataloging activity of an organization, an art dealer taking inventory, or any number of other contexts.

There are two relationships to note with this pattern. The first is that the broader activity has a part which is the AttributeAssignment. This gives some basic temporal context for the assignment. There is also in many cases a set of objects or other resources that provide additional context. In the Exhibition case, the set of objects and their labels in the exhibit is involved in the provision of the Name of the individual object.",Previously-Held or Context-Specific Assertions,,,
136,Inferred Data,"Some assertions, or even entire resources, are computationally inferred from other data rather than being evidenced in primary source literature or history. It is useful to tag these resources as such, so that they can be treated appropriately when it comes to research making use of them: if the underlying data has errors, these errors will have been propogated to this resource.

The way that this can be signalled in the data is to add the ""computer-generated"" concept aat:300202389 to the resource in the classified_as field.",Previously-Held or Context-Specific Assertions,,,https://linked.art/example/event/2
