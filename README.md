# The LOUD Social Fabrics

Repository created for one empirical chapter of my PhD Thesis – [Linked Open Usable Data for Cultural Heritage](https://phd.julsraemy.ch) – called _The Social Fabrics of IIIF and Linked Art_. 

## Analysing consensus building and advocacy initiatives across the IIIF and Linked Art communities

The [first folder](01_consensus-advocacy) hosts files and documents which aim  to analyse capacity-building and advocacy initiatives within the IIIF and Linked Art communities. The data was collected from guidelines on each initiative's website, such as cookbook recipes to help create resources and principles, as well as meeting minutes produced in Google Docs and GitHub issues.

## Socio-technical Survey

The [second folder](02_survey) contains data and scripts that were used to create figures for a survey report.
