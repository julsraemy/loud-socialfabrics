Similarity of expectation, to create a seed group among library (IIIF) or museum (LA) tech people in hopes of encouraging adoption. IIIF provides some expectation for LA folks about how long these things take to come to fruition in a first, early form. However, there are fundamental differences between them. The most important is that the IIIF use case was clearly able to be articulated and understood - it is much simpler, and perceived as a more common problem. Staff could justify spending time experimenting and learning, helping expand the community over time.

We do what our clients need to have done, many of the capabilities are easy to maintain over time without lots of community interaction. There are things I would like to see the community explore in future to solve different kinds of needs that what IIIF is used for today (and talked with others about them), but there does not appear to be a lot of motivation and I/we do not have the capacity or additional bandwidth to go further with those ideas.",Disagree,Agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Disagree,"It is a successful community, and appears to have a sufficient management structure and committed community leaders.

Rob and Kevin have built credibility with funders and sustained support for the group. A few institutions have made significant progress in real, demonstrable implementations (but too few, unfortunately, for the years it has been in progress). LA has built on a museum community interest in linked data and general data sharing which really began to surface in about 2012, and early promotional work like the AAC and some institutions'/consultancies' explorations have built awareness that has then attached to LA as a future ""potential.""","This question is hard for me to answer, as we are in a unique position. We actively support the community, but the projects and problems we work on have often been ahead of where the community is working, in terms of specific areas of data they are modeling/standardizing.

There is a small group that meets regularly to discuss modeling. There is a broad interest in the wider  museum/cultural digital/data community for the *idea* of linked data to support interoperability and use. The gap that bridges those two groups is still quite large. It is possible that reaching v1.0 will help that, but the specification is centered a lot on data availability (put linked data out there and others can use it), more than on adoption, use, and advocacy/support. That hopefully will come, but it will have to broaden beyond the small core group. There is another, possibly more fundamental challenge that highlights the difference between IIIF and LA. Data is HARD. Data completeness, cleanliness, cataloguing standardization, cross-referencing/linking, classification, description, etc. are hard problems that institutions don't do well. Also, the collection management system implementation world is rife with customization, so standardization across museums is poor. This is a huge lift. Data is much harder than images. Currently there is no ""ladder"" (as I mentioned for IIIF) to start small, solve useful problems, and move forward incrementally. It's a much harder problem than IIIF's.",,,
