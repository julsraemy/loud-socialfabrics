More than 100 registrations (~50% attendance). Mostly from Europe. Good session recidivism rate.,"Mapping exercise (with short notice of the object to be mapped) went smoothly, perhaps due to previous experience in this from calls. ",Need to consider following up with people who suggested mapping exercises:,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uItTusyxYXs2MPDarHuQWAEwhv0bfiCQnMRbN5V63lE/edit,"Complex object suggestion of performance, one for further along","Linked Art III Proposal - Not funded by AHRC/NEH, no feedback so far.",Thanasis - AHRC is funding PhD based at National Archives around Linked Data,Linked Conservation Data,Condition Checking,"Record when object last checked, why it was checked, condition. As freetext not structured. Also condition types.","Rob - Model already has event in Provenance that could be expanded to cover condition events. Baseline version would be Encounter, could be used for inventory taking or condition report",George - Using Encounter possible but should Conservation Event be in their own wrapper.,Rob - Encounter fairly broad - “This actor was in this location at this point in time”,Joe - Would need to add to that is it deliberate (purpose of encounter) and physical interaction (type of encounter). ,Thanasis - Would need to be activity as intention is part of the condition check ,George - Scope note mentions intentionality ,Thanasis - That’s not quite same as condition checking.,George - Observation class might be an alternative,Kevin - Confusion of meaning of condition checking,Joe - Condition checking covers a variety of possibilities and degrees to the extent of the condition check,Rob - Lots of nuance to condition checking.,Kevin - Assessment versus comparison to existing condition record,"Joe - Depends, can be to confirm existing damage hasn’t changed, or to identify new damage. Some place require condition checking in isolation and then comparison afterwards (to last assessment)",Thanasis - Should be part of the object model,"Rob - Not sure if should be directly in object, part of conservation activity wrapper. Otherwise the object record gets too large over time.","Rob - Could be top level type. Seems tied to provenance, as often related to moves, but not always.",Kevin - Would just need to document people get Provenance and Condition separately ,"George - Registrars need to know where object is. If we have one wrapper for Provenance and another one for Conservation, harder to get the comprehensive picture (would need to merge the data)",Thanasis - Conservation records would not include move of object around the institution,"Joe - Agree, that type of movement not part of conservation, but also not sure if it’s part of provenance either. If an object is moved after 150 years in one place, which results in some fundamental change. That movement is not provenance or conservation, more administrative. Movement could be driven by multiple purposes.","Kevin - All the data is there, would just need to be combined by someone using the API",Joe - Useful to clarify to users of the API that linkage can be made between different part of the model,…,Joe - How do we model time. The present state of knowledge (Condition) becomes historical knowledge (Provenance),Rob - Phases an option but have avoided so far. Wikidata has tried to solve this through structured properties. ,Joe - Trickier in Linked Art API. A Condition event over time becomes a Provenance Event.,Kevin - Need to document that all movement events need to be assembled together,Joe - Can the same event be provided by two APIs at the same time. ,Environmental Requirements & Hazardous materials,Would need text setting out optimal conditions that object should be kept in and text setting out hazardous materials and treatment,"Joe - Tricky. If you want to setup an exhibition on a group of objects, the data in structured form would be most useful to see the range of environmental conditions needed for an exhibition as a whole. For example if one object has much lower lighting conditions required than others, it has series of consequences for exhibition planning.",Thanasis - Agree but requires further work to model this. Trying to describe this would require Event Templates from CRM ,Kevin - Should some of these things be more prominent e.g. hazardous materials,"George - Could take a incremental approach, start with freetext description fields but plan later on to add structured fields.",Joe - Plans afoot to improve these things in collections management systems. Wanting to avoid setting a limited form of this in stone in the data model preventing us from expanding it in the future.,Homework,  For next call ???,Thanasis to create issues for the individual items and attempt to progress with fleshing solutions for easier decision in a following meeting.,  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And will switch Wednesday call to the conference technology. Worth it to run through mapping technology for the conference call? ,"Rob: For Monday session (done before) straightforward, tombstone with expanding to provenance. Don’t want to scare off at first session. So Signet ring or Rijksmuseum object. Replay the mapping of the Stieglitz photograph. Edward is ok with that.","Emmanuelle: Question if Wednesday is still open? More data modelling on Wed? Kevin: Same time as Wed call. Emmanuelle, risk of proceeding as too technical for people exposed to LA for first time. Modelling on the fly is very powerful. Demystifies the work. ","Kevin: Can consider the Wed call at the mapping call or email offline. Rob some agenda is good. Intros may take time. Emmanuelle: we have four sessions so they could be time. As for Thursday, formal paper presentation. Any more thoughts? Kevin: B/c only an hour maybe slightly less presentation driven? Emmanuelle: CIDOC attracts early career practitioners. There is a paper that will be published by conference organizers. Kevin: Have a look via email about V&A presentations and DH presentations that did not happen. Can be adapted. Emmanuelle will get back to organizers about the details for each session.",Issue 311 Image rights,Dave: Common statements that can be used across collections. Rob: and types of objects. ,Rob: Text we have covered. Structured data form (We may not need). ,"In diagram CCBi. Usage rights not generic, has to be specific. Rights “E30” do not have many properties. Some attempt to move forward. Could refer to statement just as text (does not refer to the object). Antoine: (statements not linguistic object). Rightsstatements.org, two patterns. Standard statement eg CCBi. Oddity of having a type link between a specific and a more general. Use W3C recommendation but semantics are different. Statements could be standard CC statement or more complicated. Felt that it was a departure from current rights statement procedure. ","Rob: Is CRM pattern under a rights statement. Antoine: 99% will look different and be more complex. Exploited loophole b/c rights statements are generic things. Standardized like CCBI or statements “no copyright, no date”. Could be more than two levels. Super statement from complex statements. Talking about digital images with complex copyright and IP, hard to model but need to keep door open. ","Rob: Extra complexity for blank node in rights data. Not incorrect just obnoxious. Antoine, may not be incorrect, just a statement.","Rob: What about treating it as a standardized statement (more obnoxious?). Antoine: Depends on use cases, strange to consider “no copyright, no commercial” as a linguistic object. Rob: Should be the page not the concept. ","Rob: If consider CCBi, with text following. Not ideal but best we can do? Dave: Linguistic object or URI? Rob: Image is subject to E30 right, and right is classified by license. No text to display. Dave: That would work for aggregation, but in the case of one with a tighter rights control would need a way to provide actual text of the restrictions. Eg internal use (Exhibition objects, and need to contact a specific person for publication). There may be details to convey for the full idea. ",Antoine: Good example for CRM pattern. Extra nodes to convey. More complex pattern may work. COuld be a landing page or SKOS node. Would a linguistic object or document. May give us a unified pattern for complex statements or statements with textual nodes. ,Rob: This is a reason for going the more complex route. Get this option. ,Antoine: Should we keep the simplest pattern for the simple cases? Dave: Other cases showing both cases to unify data and the querying behind it.

But that we should not fight the issue.,George: will collect minutes from the meeting.,Community,"Next call (modelling) is scheduled for November 4th, probably coinciding with the US election count reveal.",Rob: should we reschedule or cancel?,Thanasis: well Linked Art is not US-only!,Bree: a distraction would be welcome.,Rob: let’s continue with it.,Richard: also - UK bonfire night!,Rob: The SIG is also meeting on Thursday and Friday (George is partially responsible for the agenda). Is it possible for anyone to join?,George: I don’t think it’s necessary to register. It’s not a closed group. Just let me know by email.,Modelling,Issue 364,Rob: this concerns buyers and sellers both having agents in a provenance event. For example: current owner employs someone to go to the auction house and sell something on his behalf; the seller employs someone to go to the auction house and buy the item. The net result is simply that the item transfers ownership between buyer and seller.,Rob: the Getty does have considerable information relating to this. Does anyone else?,"Emmanuelle: certainly the YCBA doesn’t, officially. The reason is that it’s really hard to know when agents acted in official roles. Which is not well documented for obvious reasons. It’s rare to come by source data for that type of scenario. As I hear from my curators.",John: it’s hard to have the definite proof. Assumptions can be made from auction catalogues. You can see the sale in a catalogue and then perceive that the item shows up in someone’s collection and then infer the relationship between the owner and the (agent) buyer.,Joe: do we need a specific pattern for this? What about a nest aspect?,"Rob: provenance activities are already partitioned into different components. If we wanted to express this degree of precision, I think the model might work, however it might be very gnarly. It may not be worth documenting this level of complexity.",Joe: a straight chain might mean that most software loses the data along the way.,"Rob: X object is transferred from B to A. This is already a gross simplification of what is happening. We could easily partition this up if we had greater granularity of activities, but this is not how it’s done in CRM.",George: we should raise this conversation with the SIG. Changing the range of acquisition from physical-thing to a right would be a breaking change (and a big problem). But that doesn’t mean that the early modelling choice was the best one; and does not preclude the invention of a (or more) superclass to handle data which is being created/surfaced by groups like Linked Art.,Rob: flag as Raise to SIG? Put it on the docket for a future (not this week’s) agenda? For now leave as out-of-scope.,George: seems sensible.,"Joe: +1. Is there a way to cheat? I have a relationship here, which is more fully described in this long chain. You have the short sale A-B, satisfying the simple use case. But then nest all the complex in-between transfers A-C-D-E-F-B, etc. Therefore someone with the data can start modelling before SIG resolves pattern.",John: One Frick example sourced from the cat raisonne: https://arcade.nyarc.org/record=b1604647~S7,One more that we are sourcing from the auction catalog. https://arcade.nyarc.org/record=b1576701~S7,"Rob: re: John’s point, it’s hard to get to actual evidence for these events. We can model them, we don’t need additional ontology or docs. But we don’t know for sure that A1 was acting on behalf of A.",Rob: raise Rights Transfer issue to the SIG. The issue of being uncertain about the activities being performed is just a lack of knowledge about the agents (potentially) involved that we can’t deal with.,Issue 366,"Rob: adding to and removing things from collections. This comes up in Exhibitions, as Dave notes. The Set of objects that is the collection (auction lot, or set managed by institution, or set in exhibition). If we want to track the activities causing objects to be added or subtracted from these collections, then we need somewhere to manage that activity. Three possibles:",On the object (all add and removes are on the object),In the collection,Separate (a new top level activity which is only the manipulation of things into sets; potentially could be a Provenance activity),Joe: how does this relate to the general concept of Groups?,"Rob: I think it’s exactly that. If Rob joined Yale on September 21st. Is that part of Rob or part of Yale? If it’s part of Yale, there’s going to be a lot of those. But if it’s part of Rob, it will include all the various groups he has joined.",Jonathan: seems to me that this should be at the Group level. We can presume the join/exit dates from the exhibition. We only need to record the exceptions.,Rob: (channelling Dave) if the connection is on the object and the object is not managed by the institution that is putting on the exhibition then we would not be able to create the link in the context of the exhibition. If I wanted to make Rob’s favourite objects from around the world…,[Edward lost connection for two minutes],Emmanuelle: you will not find any not-fully-accessioned objects on the YCBA website. We do not record presence of long-term loans.,"Joe: we do have long term loans. We have information about exhibitions which have come to us. We have paintings in Japan, so we don’t necessarily have control of the list of objects our paintings have joined.","Richard: we do sometimes put loan objects online but not exhibition loans. When we are loaning to another institution, we do say that it is on loan and where.","Rob: for Exhibitions, this seems like the membership / participation of an object in an exhibition is subtly different to the addition of an object to the Set. Saying that the object was in an Exhibition seems like a useful thing to be able to say. But it seems presumptuous to say that there was an activity adding my object to an exhibiting curator’s Set that they made a choice to do this. The distinction: great if objects can record their provenance, including participation in exhibitions. But if there’s a reason to be more specific about an activity that added an object into a set, then it’s the Collection’s responsibility for recording that.","Joe: if you were using this data and queried a graph for an object, what data would you want back when you fetch its provenance? First question: where do we record this data. Second: where do we present it? How does the user get to that? How is it expressed?",Rob: would be useful to have these links from the objects to the exhibitions but not necessarily the activity by which they were added.,Richard: trying to split in my mind the difference between workflow (movement of objects) and provenance. The fact an object was in an exhibition was true. But because it replaced another one because it is light-sensitive is also true.,"Jonathan: yes, lots of researchers are interested in this. Especially if a work was removed early. Agree that the provenance event is: the work was in the show.",Joe: where would you record the fact that four of the objects in the exhibition need to be covered on Thursdays? Intermediate events that haven’t involved the moving of the object.,"Jonathan: do not believe that this is data that we store in the system. Conservation does manage this type of thing, but we do not make collections system data like this available.",Joe: is this linked conservation data?,Thanasis: two things: One: the plan that you need to cover the thing every week. Then you have the record of whether the thing has been covered. Have not yet dealt in detail with this in Linked Conservation Data but we should do soon.,Joe: total light (rather than lux level) allowances are starting to be recorded. So data is going to exist. But can we model a more generic level?,Thanasis: Activity Plans will definitely cover that sort of thing. This is a different question to whether an object was part of a Set.,"Rob: Richard captured it well distinguishing between workflow and provenance. These things are tied together but distinct. If we need to document the action that adds/removes an object from a Set then it goes on the Set. Otherwise, responsible by the object.",Issue 362,"Rob: in order to render a web page, it would be useful to have a Linked Art based summary of an entity that doesn’t have all of the information but a subset instead. This then would be a separate API interaction, rather than about all of the knowledge. Use cases are around result sets and summaries. Showing a quick card of the object rather than a multi-page thing. Plus ones from Dave and Ethan. This is also related to search. Having the set of fields which could be exposed for the minimum representation of the object would be useful.","Joe: wondering if you want to think of Templates here. This is a use case of pulling back a painting/image/whatever else. Request all of the data, but push it through a template or filter. This allows generic implementations rather than many unique API endpoints.","Rob: API design-wise, having alternate representations of resources is something that lots of info systems have: formats, subsets. Can be client or server side and there are good examples of both. Impossible to get this right for every particular case. Imagine that we will need to iterate on the approach, but if there’s a useful set of properties, we might be able to say-- here is something that doesn’t require publishers to do an awful lot. ",Richard: we are building the new API for our collection site. We’ve ended up with doing a subset of results to power the results and then the full record on an object page. ,Joe: what are you querying?,Richard: Elastic,"Joe: certain aspects, however small, might be distant along long chains of graphs. Risks over-providing data.",Rob: Search. Is there a use case that doesn’t revolve around search.,"Chris: there are different experiences you want to offer. So for an app or a website, it’s not only search.",Joe: are these just hard-wired into the app?,"Chris: for example, we also do rewrites.

Welcome to do a presentation if you are doing work on Linked Art or semantics.","Also, Linked Art community, as part of its work has always documented itself. George has been working on systems to create more analytic documentation to note the patterns that we are producing and give them identifiers and names. Can we slice down to the “building blocks” that are declared good by the community. Creating a data infrastructure for this and sorting the information. Also working on another document that has this level of granularity. Once it becomes more solid, can be presented here and discuss if this is a good path and strategies for naming the patterns. Documentation on site has dual levels, generic and models. This would take it down one more level, so one could use pieces to construct models according to Linked Art verified/approved patterns. It could support efforts from people coming at different angles or different software. ",Rob: Not to replace existing documentation with automatically generated documentations. But to extend and have more a specification approach. More use case and model driven. Gives an interesting tool to see how we already use the construction. Can determine extent of future changes.,Richard: Collections Trust UK link added to chat.,Rob: There is a good presentation about decolonizing the database.,"Cultural Sensitivity Fieldshttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/355 Question: How to model the flag as data, rather than a statement?",Introduced by Richard.,Question for Linked Art: How should the URI be modeled? Statement would be straightforward. Is “Culturally Sensitive” a classification of the object? Or something else. ,Kevin: Raising licensing quality should be avoided? And how much is related to the object and how much to the labelling?,Richard: Mostly used now for Outdated terminology. If repeated in then flagged again. Images can be flagged separately if the image is sensitive but the object is not. ,Chris: Objects themselves could be sensitive and could be tagged. Richard: Work on that will likely start up after return of curators.,Rob: Yale is beginning to look a bias and racism so this could be important.,"Kevin: This is a large field, so beginning activities included in the proposal. Talking with V&A about possible collaborative project. Pitt-Rivers has a labelling project.","The act of flagging is important, not the note at the end of it. Discerning between the flags may be too much work. ","George: This seems to be part of CRM phases? These are classifications from the stand point of now. And values can change. Almost certainly need an event, if not a phase, for the assigning of value. ",Rob: So attribute assignment on the object. Assigns “sacred” as a type to the object?,"George: Yes, social status. It is a function. ","See Antoine’s chat comment: yes what I’ve heard about these issues (rightsstatements.org wants to work on this) is about access so enabling what Yer says, independently from a specific UI implementation.",@Rob in principle all (most?) of TK is about the digital material and access to it. Though I guess it could also apply to the original material (in a physical exhibition space for example),Rob: Could be applied to digital or physical if needed.,Antoine: Choose to focus on digital because of access. May reflect on original but not always the case. Flag indirectly refers back to the object. So good to keep the option open. ,Rob: Limited number of URI’s (18). Should implementation recognize this URI’s or do we need a metatype “cultural sensitivity flag”.,Anotine: Use TK as first example. Richard: TK dealing with particular set of circumstances not solving all problems.,Rob: So then we would want a metatype on the flag. Or on the attribute assignment?. More consistent would be the metatype. ,Kevin: Capturing the event of the flag occurring is crucial and should be in the data.,Rob: Should it be separate from the object it is assigned to? Is it it’s own model that can be applied across institutions?,"Kevin: Need to capture that the choice was made, who undertook the act. ","Rob: Think we get that from attributed assignment: carried out by, timespans etc. Dimensions as a comparison (who did the measuring).",Justified this as an attribute assignment.,George: This is a pattern we would want to document as in theory applicable to any part of the model? Rob: Visual and textual can definitely be problematic.,"George: As a general pattern, should it apply across the model?","Rob: Can a person be culturally sensitive. George: A group, yes. A person could be sensitive. ",Chris: Question of stereotype on person?,George: Example from Canada. 1st PM MacDonald terrible policies with indigenous peoples so now a culturally sensitive person.,Rob: Places can be sensitive. Provenance can be sensitive.,"Name of object inscribed on parthttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/359 Just duplicate information?",Edward: Did exercise thinking about the attribute assignment about the writing of the title on the back. ,Rob: SOmeone would have done some exercise in naming or labelling. ,Edward: Do we have to know the act in order to model the attribute assignment.,Yer: Title type as inscribed so this is part.,Rob: In Getty there is classification of the name if it is on the object.,"Where the name of the object is important. We do not want to refer to the name outside of the object record. This is nice if the part is separate from the whole. The name is carried by the part of the object. Could apply to other things, eg signature. Least change to what we have now. Add property to “names”. ",George: Eloquent. Possible b/c E44 and E31.,Emmanuelle: There could be confusion. On backs of paintings there could be many labels with different titles. Some of these labels might be from exhibitions.,Rob: Other options: Make name its own resource. Problematic because everything is name. Not important that name is text. Back can carry the name separate from title. ,Attribute assignment way is difficult b/c do not know much about the actual assignment and conflicts with the exhibition case. ,"Emmanuelle: Concern about not being able to retrieve all titles, including the titles crafted for the purpose of exhibitions, when querying for titles. ",Rob: need to write up exhibition cases. And see how easy it is to get from one to the other.,So allowed carried by to refer to the physical object that carries the name.,"Agents for buyers and sellers in provenancehttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/364 Too complex/lack of data to be in scope?",Rob: Came up in Getty provenance work.Transaction with both buyer and seller have their own agents. Do not know what agent worked for whom. Also do not know if there was any custody for the agents.,It would be a lot of effort if we were to do this everywhere. Would have to change provenance structure to allow further partitioning. Would have to be included for all provenance activities.,Examples in issue informative.,Is it too complicated at this point? Can always defer.,Chris: really a separate study. Is the labelling good enough for querying different roles?,Richard: Don’t really have this in object record?,Rob: Not really in Yale? ,Emmanuelle: Paul Mellon did have agents. ,Rob: Come back and think about ways that this would not be too complicated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Offered time and what we can benefit from?,"Emmanuelle: all online and totally free. We have put in for four different time slots. Roughly everyday 4pm Geneva time. Four types of things to achieve: 1 LA meet as a working group (Monday). 2 Workshop hoping to be joint session between Linked Art and CRM (Wednesday) 3 Panel (Thursday). 4 More technical discussion b/tw LA and CRM working group (Tuesday, could happen Wednesday).","George: Vision for Monday session is not a workshop, more an introduction. Thanasis: Monday could be more like London with people bringing in data and creating models. ",Thanasis: Meeting tomorrow and will bring up schedule. CRM and LA issues discussion Wednesday. Workshop on Monday in the late session. Question is to filling up the hour on Tuesday.,"Kevin: replication of London event online will need big chunks of time, probably not right for CIDOC. What we do on the modelling calls on Wednesday could be done in an hour. Is that the right way to go forward?",Rob: Sounds right ending agreement from conference. Tuesday could be given back to organizers or could be another workshop. Discussion Wed. Panel Thursday. ,Kevin: Flexibility because of modelling calls on alt Wednesdays. And there could be benefits for CIDOC attendees to see. ,Rob: Monday as “performance art”. Tuesday as drop in modelling.,"George: usual plan Monday is intensive interaction semantics. The other session is more like advertising, get in touch with working group (less intensive). Dependent on virtual performance. Monday attendees to CRM should have basic lingo in head and then if interested look into Linked Art. ",Issues:,"Position of inscriptionshttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/348Discuss relative positioning of carried content - out of scope beyond a note?",Rob: If knowing where the inscription is how do we present that in structured data? ,Dave: Location info in inscriptions/marks is in text. “Lower left corner”. Not normalized. IIIF images of inscriptions could be included? ,Rob: Detail image would work nicely with structured data. Carries inscriptions and has representation of the detail of the object. ,Dave/John multiple terms to represent the same quadrant. Same with any vocabulary.,Thanasis: Areas on painting by quadrants could be places not locations?,Dave: Structured form usefulness as opposed to an aide.,Thanasis: Conservation POV annotate from photograph rather than using words. Probably doesn’t apply to signatures. ,Rob: 3D images makes it much more complicated. ,Richard: Provided example in chat. Same type of location info. In Marks and Inscriptions field. Cataloging completeness can vary.,Rob: Are there sufficient usecases for creating a physical part? Maybe with a separate image of the inscription. Material could be interesting too “signed in ink” on a watercolor.,Thanasis: Partitioning should not be a problem for creation of part. Capacity for having separate material is useful.,Dave: Do we want to require expression of data in both ways when more detailed expression is available? ,Rob: Valuable to have both. Because gives easy way to render content to a human. And if there are research questions that arise that query can be run. ,Dave: Also for computer readability. ,"Object State specific dimensionshttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/251","Rob: Linked Art and Linked Conservation with its more scientific focus. Want to have ability to record dimensions as well as how the dimensions were obtained. Allows us to put more properties on. Eg Curator, ruler. ","We have ability to measure, but do not have a pattern for measuring while an object is in a particular state. Could add property “technique’ that refers to some state of the object. Eg box while open. Technique =  box while open. Unframed, etc.",More complicated when dealing with parts. Overall state of the object gives flexibility for vocabulary term to be used across institutions. ,"Other proposal would be multiple types. Put on the dimension. Or using state (open, closed). That requires having states which is something we are trying to avoid. ",Thanasis: If wanting to compare height without frame you would have to go through attribution assignment technique. For with/without frame. Is there real advantage. ,Rob: One issue no “openness” Widthness works but could not match on “open”.,George: Advantage of attribute assignment is there is a problem with grouping dimensions. Attribute assignment lets you say it is “open” even if not knowing agent or time. Can group together which is useful. ,Issue of Time based media. (Thanks Karina!).,Thanasis: Attribute assignment gives more flexibility. Good solution.,Rob: This would be just one more field to something we will use quite often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We've not discussed others,7 requirements,3 patterns.,First pattern (full) fails requirement 7,Simpler meets all requirements,Baseline fails at several requirements,So Simpler seems the way to go.,Joe: what sits under these nodes? URIs for which more info is available?,Rob: Person and Visual Work are individual derefenceable resources. Identifier wouldn't be.,Joe: the content is not resolvable. Would the Complex pattern have the URI elsewhere? Combination of the Full and the Simpler?,Rob: yes identifier as string vs identifier as URI,We can do Full + Simpler and the documentation would state how to handle the options,Joe: what type of thing is 'painting.jpg'. The info is not present,Rob: the info would come from the fact the link from Digital Object,The other option would be to have a stub report about the URL. But then we could smush this record in Baseline.,But then we lose the possibility to have consistent resources.,Joe: someone building software on the data would need to know,Kevin: the question is what is the capability on the other end.,Rob: distinction between a representation (giving back pixels) and a service (giving back a description),Kevin: IIIF is a good example,Rob: the other rationale for having DO as a base entity is that we can apply other patterns to it.,Joe: how about derivatives?,Rob: out of scope,Joe: DO1 and DO2 related to the same object. To allow the basic model to state that this concept is possible would be good.,Rob: could you create an issue?,"Joe: I don't think we need to fully do it, but if we come with a model to link to DOs, it would be good to indicate that more is possible (but stop here).",Kevin: rights could be added as a requirement,Joe: rights management could be delegated to services,"Antoine, Kevin: it's about the status not the management",Joe: agreed,Rob: what kind of info would we like to have for a DO?,Antoine: slippery slope. We've done it at Europeana,"Rob: what couldn't we live without? Classification, rights, creation information…",Dave: MIME type?,Antoine: for the record here is what Europeana has (on a class called WebResource),https://github.com/europeana/corelib/wiki/EDMObjectTemplatesEuropeana#edmWebresource,Rob: we can cover all of these with the list we have in [some mysterious place],"Links to representation, links to services, rights, media type for v1.0","Joe: technique? Like commentary on the representative type (X-ray, visible spectrum, etc). Technique of the creation process. Could be interesting to search for.",Dave: what about set of images (e.g. sets that provide a 360 view of an object or a set of audio recording that represent a set of lectures). Would we rely on a IIIF manifest for this?,Rob: a link to a set. Links to individual resources. Or partitive relationship.,Antoine: at Europeana we've thought of hierarchical object (thus part of),"Joe: It contains bugs, but is this useful: https://jpadfield.github.io/cidoc-crm.examples/models/mermaid_imageexam.html","Rob: Europeana uses ""has service"" to link to, we could do the same",Joe: what's the service? Returning a jpeg or a manifest?,Rob: https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#service ,Joe: would we say that the image is included in the manifest?,Rob: we'd leave it for further elaboration,Rob: for the ??? I don't think there is a specific property in CIDOC CRM,Antoine: how about using the URL as the identifier of the DO,Rob: this would require content negotiation,Antoine: we do consider that they are in kind of records,Joe: there could be several DOs?,Antoine: yes,Rob: I see the point but the amount of data to be transcluded would be too high.

Works for the provenance with different departments as well.,Nicola the timespan is a problem when attached to the entire event. ,"Rob General classifications go on the top event. Can sub events have types, yes. But not the same as parent they should be more specific. Timespan of the event is the maximum of all of its parts, not required.

Could but not necessary.,"George: If thought there would be more information that would extend the timespan, so not sure about outer bounds and could have another instance with only knowing a vagueness. This could be a note.

",Class as exchange. ,Antoine: need to include a class that is useful for the provenance event. ,George higher level of CRM activities would make us find what is common to all provenance activities. ,Antoine can have activities independent of a wrapper?,Rob: Wrapper is not a big cost versus having multiple patterns. Wrapper allows 1 for consistency in API and 2 we do not know the causal relationships,There is a large vocabulary that could exist in Purchase but this may be better as type of provenance event. ,George scope note for provenance event so it is known when to apply it? CRM move from storage to gallery is different than from one museum to another. ,"Antoine: Production and destruction are excluded. Only exchanges. Rob: It’s the events in the life span of a piece of art. Production and destruction are one to one, not needed on the API level.

You may then become the defacto authority responsible for that entity.,"Rob: But without URIs for key entities, we lose the wrapper for our data.","Ethan: But if you have two John Smiths, distinct entities, and you know nothing else about them, then minting distinct URIs will accomplish something - disambiguates the two, lacking no other info.","Antoine: but it could be that the John Smiths in your case were actually the same, you didn't know.","Adam: But two blank notes doesn’t indicate that those two John Smiths ARE the same, just that you know the names and they happen to be the same.",Kevin: The issue is whether as an institution you are able to maintain the URIs that you put out there. It is a policy issue of which entities you wish to maintain.,"Adam: Worth saying, “here’s the costs of these practices”. Initial cost to implement URIs is low, but grows over time with maintenance.",[discussion of blank nodes vs. institutional URIs],George: blank nodes --> can’t point to that thing now or at a later time.,General point: can’t encode authority.,"Antoine: Something to ask institutions: if all you have is a name, is it worth minting and maintaining a URI? A bridge too far.",Rob: Let’s create a list of top level entities that would require creating URIs.,"Human Made Object (ours - NOT exhibitions, depictions)","People (except external authorities, e.g. VIAF, ULAN)","Group (except external authorities, e.g., VIAF, ULAN)","Place (except external authorities, e.g., TGN)","Collection/set (actual collection itself, not the members of it)",Provenance Event,Visual content (except external authorities),Textual content (except external bibliographic authorities),Digital Object,Event/Period (except external authorities),Exhibition,Sami: how about when you're publishing an exhibition list and it's not your objects? (qualifier added to HMO above),Adam: Creating URIs and making statements about them requires clean data.,"Rob: [summarizing above list] - If in the data you encounter a URI that identifies a Person, Place, Group, Place, Textual content, then you should expect that at the other end it may not necessarily be Linked Art (likely use of external authorities. For HMOs, Collection/Set, Provenance Event, Visual Content, Digital Object, Event/Period, or Exhibition, you SHOULD expect to get Linked Art (though there will be exceptions).","Rob: When you dereference a LA URI for certain entities, within the returned JSON you would publish other identifiers from external resources.","Athanasios: So, if you have a link to an external authority, you will always get there going through Linked Art.","Antoine: Possibly problematic wording. Future proof our language - we’re saying you will get Linked Art, but should be “you SHOULD expect to be able to get Linked Art”.","Antoine: Question - the links to external resources - are we saying these links should be present in the LA presentation that is dereferenced from the URI? Is it only accessible from dereferencing, or available in the main document. So we're trying to control the verbosity of the ""main records""?","Rob: Example - within a Production Event, the carried out by statement would only include the URI, type, and label. Avoid verbosity, as the document for that entity that carried out the production would provide the full information.",David: Question about mechanisms/syntax for referencing external identifiers,Kevin: Implementation choice of whether/where you use an external identifier vs. internal.,"Antoine: Why not use directly the recommended identifier (e.g., ULAN) instead of using the internal identifier, if you’re ultimately recommending that the external is the preferred?",Dave: could be a case of an internal identifier that we prefer other people to use as reference.,"Rob: Using both says - don’t use OUR identifier for reconciling, use the external identifier for reconciliation.",Rob: [reiterates summary of top level entities listed above],Adam: So this will be specified in the documentation - that implementations SHOULD publish LA for certain entity types.,Antoine: And your LA would reference other identifiers.,"Rob: If you have something to say about the entity. If you don’t have anything to say, would use the external identifier directly.",David: Should you drop the Type assertion on an external identifier?,Answer: No.,Rob: Simple case - script to transform source data to JSON-LD; system that handles content negotiation,"Rob: When there are multiple representations (less simple case), the client needs to know how to request a specific format",Adam: Would like to see “shoulds” become “mays” in the documentation,"Kevin: Scenario: your institution already has a URI, do you put that into your LA JSON-LD, or do you use that URI and via content negotiation LA JSON-LD or other return can be requested?",Answer: Both are options.,"Rob: If there are other avoidances that we want to associate with URI, it would be much trickier within the content negotiation case than otherwise. Example: structuring a request to return all incoming references to the URI instead of returning outgoing.",Rob: Should we recommend a form of URI? No.,Sami: some recipes on structuring URIs could be useful for some implementers.,"Rob: Probably shouldn’t use a blank node, but how about a non-dereferencable identifier (i.e., UUID)",General: As long as the UUID is stable.,George: Need consistency in identifiers. Maintain a consistent method to produce these identifiers.,Antoine: But the John Smith example from before could end up with the same hash.,Adam: How many qualities/pieces of information should you have to publish a URI or other unique identifier that would require maintenance?,"Antoine: Return to my refusal to identify these things when there isn’t information or valuable information. In those cases, if the person has no identity outside of the context of that object, what about using a URI like .../object/person",Richard: But most institutions have system identifiers for person entities.,Antoine/George: Not all,"Antoine: If LA requires identifiers, it should be simple to mint them, even for institutions that may not have system identifiers. Prefer blank nodes, but if the URIs must be minted, make it simple to do.",Edward: Does one institution's desire to mint a fragment URI instead of a real one impede a user’s ability to find information about these entities?,"Antoine: When more information is found out, a new more legitimate URI would be minted, and be related to the old one that has been deprecated","Edward: Why have two different practices for minting URIs - whether fragment or direct, if you need a URI do it consistently. CIDOC’s Statement on Linked Data identifiers for museum objects:   http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/cidoc/PDF/StatementOnLinkedDataIdentifiersForMuseumObjects.pdf",Adam: Question is actually whether we have a URI (any URI) or not (blank node).,"David: NGA went with UUIDs, storing them in the CMS, so that data will always go along with all the other data should there be a migration. More sustainable approach than using CMS db identifiers.",Mid-morning session: Content Negotiation,"With clever systems, you can implement a single URI which can return many different representations.",Recent W3C discussions have produced guidelines for implementing content negotiation. Both are viable:,application/ld+json#profile,application/linked-art+ld+json,"IETF have not ruled that profiles should resolve to a particular pattern. However, neither is forbidden.  https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#iana-considerations",The profile parameter is already in use. ,The profile may be being used to describe either the content or the container. Which blurs the situation.,"Another consideration is the ability to register a file type against a profile. We could, therefore, propose a filename pattern and register it so that a browser could automatically handle it. Something like `.lajson` (or whatever).",Dave: do web servers support these application profiles?,Adam: yes; Apache certainly does. Luckily there are strict rules for comparing MIME types.,"Given the possibility that IETF dislike the repeating plus characters, Rob suggests using the hash pattern URI.",Antoine: possibly we should wait for the developing recommendations for application profile (not in media types) in general to conclude? ~ Maybe: https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/ ,Rob: if we want a different syntax but the same structure (Turtle instead of JSON-LD) then there’s a conflict - we would have to use a special header. As Linked Art is a JSON-LD shop then we don’t have to specify.,"Antoine: there’s vagueness between profiles and form which either describes format or content structure. The discussion between the two W3C groups resulted in a nice outcime, ie. JSON-LD ""profiles"" are rather about the ""form"" of the data than its content.","Antoine: relating to the urgency of this -- is Linked Art JSON-LD competing with other forms of JSON-LD in the community at the moment? Can we use /json-ld and wait until there is a conflict? Ethan/Rob: no, we are already using JSON-LD for other data.",Kevin (to Rob): are you going to implement both or one (of these profile choices)? Rob: Getty will implement the group’s recommendation.,"The `#profile` is in the JSON-LD context, but the `+` route does not allow representing Linked Art in other data formats.",Rob: are there other API questions?,Edward: what about the remaining CRUD operations: read/write etc.?,For now the API will just implement GET.,Dave: search?,Adam: discussions often very quickly become blocked by very specific use-cases or data.,Rob: we can always look at these things later after we have implemented GET. Being able to retrieve things is fundamental.,Adam: someone else can provide search; already Ethan can harvest and spider the data.,Adam: is search a required feature for being able to manage the data itself?,Adam: people who do perform aggregation will bring really valuable experience to future discussions relating to search.,"Rob: Getty are working on a change-publication IIIF API as a first step towards building a search API.

It is a problem if the model can’t express the ‘or’ operator because then it seems that the 2 creators collaborated when we are certain that they did not.,Rob: do we just need to make style of a new property?

Same exemplar continues next week.,Joe: have been doing more work on own GitHub system which helps generate Mermaid diagrams from committed models. Would be interested in putting together config for colours and shapes for Linked Art. Currently built from a text file containing a simple set of tab separated triples. https://jpadfield.github.io/simple-modelling/ (docs being built),Rob: Edward and Rob have also been playing around with live-modelling/diagramming Python tooling (see Showcase1 repo),Model issues:,#346: membership of arbitrary sets,All the API responses should be able to have membership of a set resource. Object part of collection. Place part of travel route set. Person part of set of people (as opposed to a Group).,"However, we haven’t really talked about Sets much, and relationship with other entities.",`member_of` is already a CRM property for constituting groups; so we could re-use the term via JSON-LD mapping.,"Thanasis: re: non-physical and physical auction items discussion at Oxford - this felt a little too specific at the time, but Rob’s outline (about) summarises the use cases well. Own opinion is that the semantics need explanations as to why things have been put together.","Rob: mixed physicality sets could be solved with their own class, but this isn’t a case where a Place would be part of the set. This might be too specific. And require reactive modelling to arising use cases.",Thanasis: appreciate that ongoing re-modelling discussions can’t happen too frequently.,"Rob: in the ontology we could note: although the range is an E1, we expect it to be used with E22s (and other entities).

Keywords are often the links software needs to use to connect things.",Rob: in favour of moving forwards with this. There are good use cases for collecting a mix of concepts together in Sets. Would anyone be disappointed if we permitted any Linked Art primary entities being part of a Set?,Joe: the limitation of CIDOC was that you couldn’t combine sets of things.,Rob: CRM doesn’t support our primary use-case of physical and non-physical things.,Thanasis: we need to recognise that a property that connects anything to anything else is not particularly useful for anything deep. But it does cover our use cases very well..,Joe: possible that people will shortcut proper semantics by using Set.,Rob: so we shouldn’t use this as a stand-in for a real relationship.,"Joe: examples will help, showing both Set use and nicely-semantically-describe relations.",Thanasis: don’t want it to be a workaround for complex modelling that you want people to do.,"Kevin: some of these slightly arbitrary Sets are tending towards being out-of-scope, even though the use-cases are well founded.","George: where does this fit into CIDOC-CRM? If it is more or less like a list, ontologically, -- ah it’s a PropositionalObject -- that’s fine, we just need a nice scope note for this. We need to be clear that you wouldn’t use it for a group of people (they have Group).",#357: cause of death,"Rob: people can die, and that’s part of the Person record; but the cause of death is an Event.",Joe: is this only people and not other things? A Group or Organisation could die. Maybe a stretch of the definition but the process is the same. Would this follow this semantic pattern?,"Rob: same relationship applied to the dissolution of the group, or the destruction of the whatever.",?: death of a racehorse? (not getting notified of who is speaking),Rob: CRM is not good at animals. We have tended to stay away from describing living creatures who are not people.,Joe: Titian’s Death of Action (sp.)? Represents event in the painting.,Thanasis: we do have BiologicalObject in the CRM.,Rob: we can declare the cause of the destruction of objects; but we cannot give the cause of death of a person. Death() currently only has time and place.,"Joe: it’s quite common for people to want to describe what materials killed artists: lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, etc. Also see death of Robert Hayden.",Joe: can the Death occur during an event?,"Rob: following the destruction pattern - it was caused by another event. The death did not occur during the stabbing, but the stabbing caused the person to die.","Rob: relatively easy to add cause property with range of another Event entity. The cost isn’t high, but if it’s not going to be useful then we shouldn’t do it.",Joe: unlikely for people to want to model old age as a cause of death.,Edward: relationship is just caused not caused death by?,Rob: Yes,Joe: this pattern could be used for many other things.,"Rob: yes, we use it for the Production of objects too. The Production was caused by commission. Current property is `O13`. I don’t think the cognitive cost for following this pattern is very high; there’s no added cost for understanding. There is a low cost for API and model documentation. Although we don’t have data in big collection management systems, it does seem worth the minimum cost of implementation.",Thanasis: the `caused_by` property looks to be using CRMsci. I think that triggered by applies to events which do not have agency. We should double check if we are using this for events with agency.,Joe: would this mean that a house being burned down because some lava flowed into it - would be compatible with the model; but someone pouring petrol on it and setting alight - would not.,Rob: if it works for events then it should work for activities. It doesn’t say only for use with E5s and not E7s.,Thanasis: there was discussion of this in relation to causality. Causality is hard to prove so we opted to make it more general.,Joe: we could preface all of the properties with is currently believed to…,"Thanasis: intent. Re: chaos theory. There was no intent on the actor’s behalf to cause something; nevertheless, it did happen. The intent was lacking.",Joe: modelling intent then may need additional commentary.,#355: cultural sensitivity fields,Richard: added this to discussion as aware. The very labelling of the topic itself may be a discussion being had also.,"Richard: in light of current events and awarenesses, we are going to be re-cataloguing and marking cultural sensitivity: what and why. At first this may be text, but linked from the issue is a vocabulary for making statements of this kind..",Richard: also data relating to who would have been able to see/interact with an object.,?: At the McCord (sp?) there are objects which need to be covered at night; can only be shown during certain seasons. There is information for this in the acquisition records but not in the ontology.,Rob: there should be a set of controlled values?,"Richard: ideally yes, although we may begin with a textual statement.","Richard: Kevin, maybe say something towards this being rolled into a future project strand?",Joe: Tate looking at extending project funding for implementing further vocabulary detoxing.,?: what about using PROV (from W3C) to record that things were stated at a certain time; rather than continually revisiting the data and bringing into line with current culture.,"Joe: the ability to capture mixed or conflicting beliefs would be wonderful. But if there are objects which have restrictions on use, how can we make this data searchable/usable/findable to a user and not just a historian of the data.","Kevin: we have proposed to AHRC to look at how institutions are approaching this work and examine what is recorded in the data. There’s potentially interesting work here: to try and understand how this maps into institutional mission and whether the data can support it. Then how this is modelled, etc., is complicated.",Rob: we have shied away from modelling how people’s beliefs have changed over time. No one has the data and it becomes very complicated very quickly.,"George: re implementation suggestion comment in issue: P2 is not right; maybe Name Use? This thing was categorised by this curator at this time and it had this now not-kocher-to-use term. Similarly: this other group doesn’t classify things as the curators do, but they consider that it has this other meaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternate Wednesdays in this time slot. Immediate data model with people on this call. Begin with O’Keeffe from October showcase. Can look at the gaps that were hand stitched by Sami. As well as changes in model. Also, should look at transAtlantic connections (Constable or Turner). Need to check back to make sure people are happy their data is used for O’Keeffe model. Sami will reach to get continued approval and/or new data. Second objective of these calls is to try out new technologies like a shared whiteboard over Zoom. ",	2 Linked Art 2 AHRC project. Launch a community outreach call for exemplars. Speculative call for beyond this group. Will be online workshops. Try to have two parts: presentation of LA as it is and break out of focused modelling over Zoom. Hope to do first round late in July and then in September. , 	3 Digital Humanities conference. Physical component cancelled. Will be digital component. LA has a panel accepted. Will go up on Humanities Commons. Can reuse these presentations for outreach workshops.,	4 Funding round “Linked Art 3” AHRC and NEH. Thanks for input. Kevin will put together from the call. ,Emmanuelle: any publishing from DH 2020? Kevin: will go into a book of abstracts (work already done).,Kevin: Trying to coordinate funding with Linked Conservation funding call (done with Thanasis).,Kevin: will put out objectives from Linked Art 3. Delicate balance from co-investigators. Looking for people from cultural heritage institutions to lead those parts of the project. ,"	Jamie: A document to show people would be helpful. Kevin: working on that but also want it to be used more than once. Joe: Subject specialities -  should we included bias? Kevin: happy to include any topic but will need co-investigator who has that as speciality. Ideal strand would be for that knowledge to intersect with an institution interested in developing LA as a technology. Richard: provenance would be doable? There are established people. Kevin: really interested in exploring that, ask your colleagues. Need to talk about provenance of a period or particular material type. Dave: Distribution of collection as to ethnicity. This may ramp up into an actual level of access and this could join LA. Joe: that will likely be the same in other institutions (similar to paintings by women at National Gallery, cannot search now). Kevin: if timing works over the next couple of months, this could be a good focus. ","Jamie: clarifying about provenance, W3C standard for each claim? Kevin: referring to ownership of work of art. Joe: Provenance = Soap opera of art history. ","Kevin: Looking for an individual who comes to mind in an institution who has interest and speciality. Also could be an institutional directive. Joe: What about Getty Provenance project? Rob: left the Getty, and a lot of data cleaning in the background. Joe: what about a curator for subject expertise? ",Model issues:,"Professional Activity vs Professionhttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/351Proposal - Add a metatype to specific professional activities, and keep professional activity as well (c.f. artwork / type of work)","Rob: Should we do same sort of pattern as artwork and type of object. Two types done professionally and what type. Would give all possibilities. Eg Profession architect; architecting without being professional, or profession without knowing what type.","Joe: Would this logic be enough to classify someone as an artist, painter, architect etc.?",Rob: should be enough. ,Joe: Clear understanding as how to query this would be helpful. ,"Rob: Lewis Carroll example, artist/author (among lots of others) this pattern allows for all activities, professional or not. ",Joe: How to get to “Lewis Carroll” from this in LA. ,Rob: {,"  ""type"": ""Person"",","  ""performed"": {","    ""type"": ""Activity"",","    ""classified_as"": [","      {""id"": ""aat:300393177"", ""type"": ""Type"", ""_label"": ""Professional Activities""},","      {""id"": ""aat:300024987"", ""type"": ""Type"", ""_label"": ""Architecting"", ""classified_as"": {""id"": ""aat:type-of-activity"", ""type"": ""Type"", ""_label"": ""Type of Activity""}}",   ],},Philippe: Can use professional activities twice? Rob: Yes. Philippe: query becomes more complicated. Rob: need to know it is professional and architecting.,Joe: How to get from the event (a larger event with multiple people) to the activity?,"Rob: from API point of view, do not have arbitrary activities at top level. Would put the activity under the person. ",Rob: this case is to find all the artists and/or all the collectors and they can be one in the same person. ,Joe: in the case of exhibition how to connect multiple people? Rob: that could be tricky. Dave: relationship with objects? ,"Joe: another model test, person with professional paintings and amateur paintings?",Kevin and Joe: question of large project over time with multiple projects. Complex query to find architects involved in creating National Gallery for example. Rob: could be associated with National Gallery as building not as a project. Joe: do not want to encode the same data multiple times. ,"Bree question of timespan, Rob included in model.",Non specific timespans? First part of century? Rob: all to the second but with fuzziness. Ontology does give flexibility with uncertain timespans. Also can say abstract period of time “Bronze Age” and activity took place in that period without saying when that abstract period is. As long as people know when the abstract period took place.,Rob: Will write up into the person model for double checking. Can cover use cases without stretching anything. ,"Identifier context https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/347",Rob: Objects move around and get identified in different ways by different people. ,Accession number example. 1997 acc number but there is a pre-1997 number. Need to know earlier museum or would have two identical acc numbers in model.,Joe: Identifier assigned by legal entity. Can this be a third party identifier? Rob: Could be a good case. ,Rob: solution is “assigned by”. Based on the id of the museum or other assigner. Lugt number would also fit in here. ,Joe: Multiple acc numbers from one institution? National Gallery exhibition gets x number. Sample gets r number. Long term loan gets L number. Purchased gets NG number. An object could have all those numbers depending on history. ,: Metatype of Accession Number? Rob: May not solve Joe’s question. ,	Rob: Is “general_purpose” enough? Does it give the intent of accession number? ,"Dave: May be more appropriate to record exhibition numbers with exh, not object. Rob: Doesn’t solve long-term loan, ",For artist numbers that is solved on the group level. Question is about multiple numbers from one institution. ,Joe: Makes query harder. Could look for all accession numbers an filter. Dave: History of accession numbers. Rob: History is easier can put a timespan on it. Not for valid but rather for when it was assigned. ,Joe: Case of acc number and Group number. Group numbers also NG numbers. ,	Rob: Is group different physical thing with its own numbers?,Rob: Basic scenario of who assignes acc number this model is good. We did add other features without problems in model. Can we move forward on this? ,Edward’s question about publication. Rob yes: “is_referred_to-by”,"Kevin: Purchase case, is that similar to groups? Sub-division of lots? Maybe use this pattern? Joe’s examples may need to be revisited. The shared acc numbers may not have to be part of LA 1.0, if not very common.",Rob: Will put out agenda earlier. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please complete the form and proffer your thoughts on all the various communication channels.",Richard: is the September plan still valid?,"Chris: The Netherlands has extended its ban on large gatherings until September, but we’re not so numerous for this to be a problem.",Rob: the CIDOC conference will delay September’s Geneva conference until December. So no longer overlapping with London/Amsterdam but now in line with a European IIIF conference.,"Kevin: sit tight, see where things end up. September is admittedly starting to look shaky; anecdotally, some October events are already looking at cancelling.",Model issues,348,Inscriptions and signations.,There is a distinction between a statement about an inscription signature or the inscription/signature itself.,"Rob: we have statements already, but we don’t have documentation explaining how to model the actual signature. There are two approaches:",Have the VisualItem of the work represent the LinguisticObject which is the actual inscription,Have the inscription being carried_by the object itself,"The trade-off is that we can make comments (in #1) about the qualities of the inscription (it’s blue, or tilted); where as (#2) gives fewer affordances.",Michiel: is the carries property already used for artwork-type patterns or only books?,"Rob: not in any of the documentation. So far only for book-like things. I could imagine that a sculpture with a carved inscription or a painting with significant text within the painting, or the words on a building -- all of these things would be text carried by an object. Therefore it’s not going to be uncommon. Although… will museum contributors have the appropriate data in their CMS?",Michiel: what exactly is a VisualItem? Can the VisualItem also carry?,Rob: carries is for the relationship between a physical thing and a textual thing. Whereas represents is more -- what is represented in the visual content. Represents is right here.,Michiel: so a LinguisticObject can be in the range of represents?,Rob: yes. Even non-physical things.,"Joe: if you want to document detail about signature then there are likely issues with simply recording a piece of text. Complexity: multiple signatures, obscured, incomplete, removed, etc. From a conservation point of view, there’s difficulty with it simply being text and a number.",Rob: VisualItem would be beneficial here as the text might be Vinc and the -ent was lost.,Joe: the signature is also a physical thing. It’s made of something.,"Rob: yes, the materials of the paint of the signature would require a physical HMO to represent the signature.",Michiel: if there is a person depicted. You might want to say it’s been done with thick paint. Maybe this is going too far?,Joe: there’s a difference between a depiction of a person (they are not in the painting) but the signature is there.,Rob: Emmanuelle also commented on a date being present. Either of the suggested patterns work for these circumstances. ,"Joe: when a photograph has been taken of the signature, where does it hang?",George: depicts more appropriate than carries for visual but needs to be balanced between pragmatic use of data. Creating VisualItem blank nodes for the sake of good modelling might actually lead to confusion if you never have any claims to make about it. Sometimes this might be better tagged as the aspect of the object.,"Rob: we have tried to avoid shortcuts wherever possible. Given that there are lots of use cases for the visual work part, I would personally prefer not to introduce a shortcut on this.","George: if normally you’d pass this sort of information through the VisualItem, then using P128_carries would be inconsistent.","Emmanuelle: it’s not unusual for new inscriptions to be acquired/discovered, and it’s important to capture them. We might describe the date when an inscription was made based on its materials.","Michiel: labels of auction house, transporters, and so on. These can be affixed to the rear of a painting. Is VisualItem inappropriate for handling all the positional information in this context? ",For example: ,"inscription: “painted in red ink”, position: left bottom side. Inscription has creator. As well as the content of the inscription.","Watermark: type, creator [empty], description: a shield with a crown holding a scimitar (etc. Latin etc.)","Rob: let’s take positioning first. We have found, in conservation, where somethings is/happened is significant. George and Rob have used a polygon, which gets applied to an image which overlays the position of the inscription. We could have the VisualItem represent the inscription and then it could have position.",Michiel: this would add another object: artwork has physical part which has VisualItem.,Rob: physical part is made of blue paint; the VisualItem part has position and description and it represents “Vincent” as text.,Michiel: the parts could then also have materials?,"Rob: yes, this could all go on to the physical part.",Joe: relative physical dimensions?,Rob: we need Thanasis.,Joe: how would you define a panel in an altarpiece? It’s a painting within a sculpture.,"Rob: yes, and then recursive parts: the left panel has whatever characteristics…",Michiel: couldn’t the physical part then just carry this inscription and we do away with the VisualItem?,Rob: visual works have some notion of space and layout but text doesn’t. So you need it for positioning. The altarpiece example is a good one. But describing the nested complexities of it in realtime was too much for the notetaker.,Michel: have asked to share examples from the Van Gogh Museum.

Will move it to September.,Discussion around the funding streams,Karina: question to Kevin about AHRC grant and the question if hiring is on track. Hiring is behind given uni admin is switching focus to covid management. There may be no cost extensions to the projects… but nothing official yet. ,"Rob: haven’t heard anything from us side on next round of funding. There was to be a workshop in april, but this seems unlikely.","Rob: grant making bodies are treating this seriously and compassionately, and there should not be a problem generated out of delays etc.",Update on documentation,Rob has updated the provenance documentation,Rob is starting to write up the API documentation that has been discussed since the Oxford meeting,Call to assistance for anyone who can volunteer to aid in this endeavour,Linked Conservation Data Update,Question of how to assure alignment between the two groups,"No official proposal yet, however, there are probably two issues to discuss:","How do we present different models e.g.: in linked art there is one way to describe dimensions. In LCD there will be a more elaborate way… when someone is approaching the api, how do we direct the request to the correct model? Perhaps technically trivial question (or not) but needs to be answered","What to do when one model updates, how do we organize dependency on the other model? We are talking about LCD but there would be other projects as well",Need an intercommunity model for managing the updates… also the question of linked pasts is another example,Question one is easier to try to tackle first,Should we invite someone from related community to describe their work in the call one in three meetings or so?,Thanasis: I was thinking that this should probably be more of a mechanical problem.  Is this realistic? This can be something to discuss in LCD meeting.,Kevin: do we separate between models and apis? Clean part of the separation of what is expected from the resource. There could be a clean separation when you identify the principle of when there would be a more specialized model/partition from the main data,Having a clear view on the conceptual model is ‘relatively’ easy. But the transition to implementation in an api is about agreeing principles of practice.,Dimensions example: should attribute assignment of measurement should be its own api endpoint or should it just be added into the object representation as it is currently in the documentation,How to know from which endpoint you get the more information? E.g. between a Linked Art dimension pattern which just has a little bit of dimension data and the LCD dimension point which would have a rich amount of information. ,Need  to see it by use cases,"Thanasis: in the long term, if other projects come on board, what level of engagement would one expect with linked art before such a discussion/relation can happen","Rob: if they want to engage, then some in the community that wants to interact should have read the linked art’s documentation","Further on down the road, when linked art documentation is more mature, can help people along more…",Richard: Linked Place framework… the work is fairly independent. Richard follows linked art to see where compatibility may come into place. The use of CRM is what is common between the projects… ,"Joe Padfield: there’s money to hire in SSHOC, to create heritage science fair data sets… they will be created with CIDOC CRM. Would be of interest to see how this overlaps with Linked.art (https://www.sshopencloud.eu/)",How does one build a test model. It would be useful to have examples of how you build your own dataset using linked art,Richard Light: find correlation with Art UK project. Looks to make a mechanism for ingestion of data in the UK. Currently planning to make use of the LIDO framework. Would be interesting exercise to match this up to / with that effort.,Emmanuelle: haven’t heard of this work. There is movement ahead on the LIDO project under a new grant. Could be useful to make sure to march in the same direction.,Joe: AHRC Discovery projects… lots of funding here.  (https://ahrc.ukri.org/research/fundedthemesandprogrammes/tanc-opening-uk-heritage-to-the-world/),"Antoine: Workshop on art research and linked data, specifically about art market research… Antoine introduced linked.art to the discussion. Good discussions. Waiting for notes from that workshop. Presently however there is some struggle to put together the notes post covid. ","Relevant Outcomes: interested in organizing shared workshops/webinar (in relation with Keven's project, among others), have linked art data model checked against the requirement of the workshop participants. They are also creating material for explaining linked open data for researchers/beginners. ",Issue 219: Representative objects,Have representative objects for an artist or style or place,Joe: could also extend this thought to representative object of spaces,Rob proposal: we should have a type to link between the two objects. Can use the pattern of the relationship modelling already in linked art. ,Thanasis: there is no substantial relationship between the two objects. This is a type of categorization relevant to a context.,Joe: do you care about context? The thing is exemplary relevant to some context.,"George: Could use attribute assignment. Seems like a common practice so we should be able to capture it. If you have a relationship and add a property on top, people will use that for everything. Context is very interesting, such as for an exhibition.  Going through an Attribute Assignment lets you contextualize using existing machinery in the model. Basic structure would be to use assigned / assigned_to, with AA node in the middle. Still wouldn't have a property for X being exemplary for Y -- this can be the type, exemplary-ness.  Then have actors and time and so on.",Joe: if we have the notion of assigning a set of things to the object as being exemplary… then should we consider order?,Rob: we try to avoid rdf:list. In json you can rely on the order which is not great but functional.,Also consider this issue in the CRM SIG: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-407-ordinal-property-for-e55-type,The question or order actually lurks in the future. ,Joe: use case… institutions top 100 objects… national gallery has done this many times. This would need context.  ,Kevin: What is relation between highlights and exhibitions? Is there an overlap there?,Should back to the relation of this to exhibitions in another context,Concerns/Decision: rob will document the attribute assignment pattern and see if it works and bring it back to the group. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I.e. include a summary of previous work on the issue and proceed discussing questions on it following from that. Theoretically one issue will feed to another, i.e. make a chain of issues (not sure I am capturing this correctly).","Agreed: Agreeing processes to allow issues or discussions that are raised during the summary are then added to the list for future meetings - makes it easier to end new discussions and stick to a planned agenda, while still letting people's ideas be discussed overall.","RS: Power of the group is in shared skills. Got to come up with a method to make setting the agenda more transparent. Commenting on issues is an indication of people being interested in them. This could be a way to set the agenda, i.e. start with issues with comments and if none is commented then move on to other. Interaction with the issue in the form of “thumbs-up” clicks is enough.",Agreed: To prioritise the commented issues for the agenda.,RS: Good idea for issue raiser to chair the part of the meeting that discusses the issue.,AV: Same practice in CRM-SIG and it works,JP: Also useful to ensure that the raiser has understood the resolution. Also an issue assignment method would be useful.,"RS: People should have access to “assign” tools if they have a GitHub account. If they are not included in the LA repo, then Rob can add them.",Agreed: That the issue raiser can chair the bit of the meeting related to the issue.,RS: The questionnaire is useful to ensure that everyone gets the chance to contribute. ,JP: Consider a separate call only on modelling with worked examples to share experience with other people. This is to address the concerns about lack of time given that the regular meetings are only an hour. A bit of modelling surgery setup,"Edward: A tag/label may be useful for an issue, so that an issue itself can be about a specific example of modeling a set of data.",Agreed: new tag on GitHub “mapping” for issues about specific datasets,"	I have mentioned this before, but I have been working on a system to visualise mapping examples: https://jpadfield.github.io/cidoc-crm.examples/ In the example it is cidoc stuff but it could be used - simple text automatically converted into interactive web models. (JP) Might even just be nice to share agreed example models, if not for discussion.","Kevin: London we put an open call out for people attending the workshop, beyond the people on the calls, to bring their favorite example and a difficult one.  Then this group helped in breakout groups to try and see how linked art fitted modeling the data. Worked well, but a step away from more validation task of working with real data from systems. The timely point of the AHRC grant will have a call for the wider community to suggest use cases with the aim to work up to detailed exemplars. One question is how to continue that in lockdown, as original plan was for a face to face. Not sure we can directly bring them together but thinking how to do it would be useful. Different to brainstorming around a table.","Thanasis: Asked consortium to submit examples of documentation. We curated them in advance to make sure they were useful examples. Purpose was also didactic for the participants. Divided into groups according to interests and people with more experience with CRM would explain the mapping. Some people were even convinced of the process :)  For LCD we consider changes too, haven’t worked out how to do it. Kristen has suggested a format of online seminars / tutorials where people bring their data and we spend an hour looking at the data online. But haven’t formalized that yet.  We can report back when there’s more discussions.","George: Great if those were recorded, especially if they solve a problem. Towards a wider issue putting something together in a PhD program in Cyprus to pick up CRM. Informal dial-in radio show for semantics. Dear abby… :D [/rs]",GB: Having visual and audio with real data and being able to follow is much more useful.,RS: Would this need to be a separate call or replace current regular calls? Possibly be a separate call as the membership may be different. At the moment two calls are not enough to cover all activity.,Kevin:  Mapping discussion where Richard  (e.g.) has data and how to map.  And then the more engaging activity to get others from outside of the group.  E.g. curation of exemplars. Two different cases (or steps to get stuck in),RS: We could usgmae the same process for the discussion but separate workflow to enter the discussion. Individual members may discuss with internal people who wish to discuss modelling and bring them in to the more topical mapping call.,KP: People in the group can discuss and deliver mappings advice to external anyway.,KW: Consider how we could keep track of specific examples to refer to in the future.,RS: Showing example of the photoarchive on the linked.art website as an example of a sample record.,JP: The specific example may be a little scary for people. Joe’s example showing visualization of triples to be shown with a direct HTML links. There is also a way to include documentation on these model-nodes. Joe built is for a specific example but we can replace the underlying data with different examples.,RS: Try to find time and example to do a more practical and model oriented call.,"Agreed: Richard to bring data for example, Edward,  Karina to flesh out use cases.

Three/four months may be more realistic.","Thanasis: for the Linked Conservation Data post, interviewing has completed and one or two hires should be announced soon.",Model issues,Issue 237 (see also 107),"Rob: proposal pending since September would be to use a simple class for relationships with some from/to attributes. However, Attribute Assignment may be a nicer way of doing this. Both patterns are very, very similar; so if we could use generic AAs then we wouldn’t have to make a relationship class. Meaning one less thing to maintain.","In relation to the model example for student-teacher-school. Attribute Assignement, used here:",```turtle,<teacher> assigned_to_by AttribAssignment,AttribAssignment assigns <student> ;,  P177_assigned_property_type <teacher-of> .,```,George: doing something like the AA pattern in order to express arbitrary things (x is related to y) as random relationship... this seems like a better pattern. But I wouldn’t make it recommended. Plus one to current suggestion.,"Joe: would you want to twin this with a vocabulary of relationships? For Linked.Art, do we centralise an agreed list of types?","Antoine: there’s always a need to find a pertinent vocabulary, which is a wider problem than the specific implementation being discussed.",Rob: how to express sufficient usability balanced with sufficient interoperability? The vocabulary and the pattern are inextricably linked.,"Thanasis: not particularly happy with the structure. The Attribute Assignment is often used to indicate that somebody has an opinion about something. In a way, I do not see the student as an attribute that the teacher receives. In some cases we may want to express this, but in others it exists already - in which case expressing an AA doesn’t make sense.",Rob: because AA is typically expressing properties not relationships?,"Thanasis: for example, if somebody is a sibling of someone else… ontologically they are [related] and not properties.",George: yes; which is why if you have any other option then don’t do this. One of the reasons we didn’t want to handle social relations is to avoid biting off more than we can chew in terms of the ontology.,Thanasis: is the problem that the CRM soc haven’t formalised the relationship properties? It’s a matter of time before Linked Art accepts their resolution. We don’t want to make a decision here beforehand.,"Joe: as an alternative, one of the ways this could be done is make the person a member of a group. Then define the relationships in the definition of the group. Also not perfect.",Rob: Getty has done this too. It works OK for people and roles. E.g. the PM of New Zealand is a Group which only ever has one member. But issues arise when we’re not talking about a person or set of people. And directionality is tricky too. Which essentially just moves the problem. Having something consistent with representative objects would be good as it would be consistent. So we want a relatively-straightforward-and-not-wrong way to express this.,Rob: ,```turtle,Conceptual Object assigned_to_by AttribAssign,Assign assigns Type ( number ),```,Does this seem semantically incorrect? Compare this purely mathematical example to the specific sibling example?,George: if you knew the direct relationship then you would use an existing component of the ontology. This has to support cases where it’s not known.,Thanasis: how soon does this need to be implemented? Would it be better to sort this is CRM SOC beforehand?,Joe: you could have relationships between two E1s. That’s the level of the generic problem.,Thanasis: I don’t think so; I think it’s within the bounds of social interaction.,George: hasn’t the problem opened up more broadly? Student-teacher is just an example. But also… the moon is related to the sun… through galaxy… things.,Rob: where we have these statements we want to use them.,Joe: any use of this data must have strict processing rules so that properties aren’t creeping into inferences for other relations.,"Thanasis: if we want to express a relationship between any two things, how valuable is allowing searching on it? Maybe we do not support such a thing with tooling.","Rob: yes, search could become terribly complicated or unreliable.","Joe: this type of relationship is important to hold on to, but how should it be re-used. There’s a difference between data being held in limbo pending being modelled and it remaining so for use.","Rob: regardless of all the other problems, the September proposal seems worse than Attribute Assignment. However AA has exactly the same set of problems with the exception that it will already be understood by CRM community members. Therefore, let’s work with SOC to explore the bonds issue. Because if there is a better pattern coming from bonds it would be better to avoid having two patterns.",Ryan: bye,"Rob: would prefer, however, to have something written down for this pending resolution at the end of the calendar year. This at least improves the situation.","Thanasis: it might be unclear, in this model, what is assigned to what. How do you decide which side the thing goes? Do we really have such a burning need for this? In terms of peoples’ real data do we need this in v1?","Rob: good question. We could be silent on it. Probably every CMS has examples of HMOs with related_object, which is similar. Both related- and representative-objects seem pretty ubiquitous. So would prefer to have something in v1, yes.",Thanasis: OK,Antoine: agree. It matches better the DCAT qualified relationship pattern. Still a bit luke warm about Attribute Assignment as it may encourage people to put provenance data here. But if that provenance is optional it's fine!,"Joe: we need several worked examples to ensure that the directionality works. You may always require pairs of AAs, because both things have a relationship. This is messy but captures the duality.",Antoine: the other pattern supported from and to.,Issue 219,(Dimensions of arrangement),Rob: Getty CMS has dimension with types which simply describe those dimensions at the time that the dimensions were taken. State does complicate things significantly in that it is an ongoing thing in an ontology that is configured around changes in state.,"Rob: is there something we want to try to work on, or defer? Do we want to tackle this?","Joe: is this a class question or a type question? Class would complicate the ontology, with an infinite number of instances of the state of the object. Making vocabulary controlled hierarchies of types is maybe a simple solution.",Object has dimension. Dimension has type width. Width has type width with lid open.,It’s a bunch of types either way you do it! At scale it might be a lot simpler to string together a lot of different dimensions than model all the events which invoke state changes in the object.,Rob: what about a polyhierarchy of the terminology: dimension terms and state terms?,"George: use technique and procedure and say that measuring in one state or another is not a function of the object. Rather that we used to open-map style of measuring. Object went through a measurement event. We would need a sensible vocabulary to describe these measuring procedures. There are real discussions about this, so presumably we can name and describe these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most meetings/conferences being cancelled. For now next face-to-face meeting in June is not far away for planning. Other conferences in June (IIIF) have not cancelled, but may delay if IIIF or others begin to cancel. No absolute reason to have it in June, good timing and splits the year, so we could delay. Recommendation to wait on travel until we know more so do not book. Fall back strategy is to delay until September (July/August not good). Would want it in the first half of September if possible. Kevin, Richard, Rob, Saskia discussing what to do and how to make the best of it.","Thanasis: Linked Conservation does not have many events this year, do have event in May in UK. May have to be cancelled. UK govt is relaxed, but does not mean people will not refuse to travel. General advice from university is to postpone until Autumn. May end up in September with many other postponed events and dates will be difficult.",Jamie: Organizing workshop in Florida in October for html hypertext.,	Canadian govt not panicking. ,Thanasis: AHRC does allow for extensions in extraordinary events. This may be the case for other institutions as well.,"Rob: Especially for collaborative projects like Linked Art. For next call for funding, would open in September possibly for February? Organizing a new project may be deprioritzed because virus, so may be delay.",Thanasis: AHRC organized two (at least) conferences to discuss next round of funding (April and possibly May) if these cancelled they will have less to work with so another reason for delays.,API issues first,#166 Blank Nodes,Rob: Answer from Philadelphia was could use blank node whenever needed except when API requires it to be a top level resource in JSON-LD. ,Thanasis: Apart from dereferencing any other problems?,"Rob: Eg if a third party wanted to annotate the blank node rather than system as a whole. Could annotate the person, but could not annotate the name specifically. That is clumsy because we do have the machinery to do this. ",Thanasis: Not encouraging. Just saying if there is not a URI then do not worry.,Rob: But if one can then one should use the URI.,Dave: Annotation could record the use of the API and not identifier? Similar to image identifying. Image of an object on a website. Gives a reference to an image without an ID (concept not an ID). But there are instances of creation of content where one has to refer to a particular image in time. Are there parallels?,"Rob: In Web Annotation Model there are cases. The source is a diskimage and selects a byte range. In Xpath Selects a span. No well known standard in graphs. JSON path could work for representation. Does rely on annotation specific machinery, but does solve for this specific use case.",Dave: If modelled everything as annotations then could solve.,"Rob: To repeat, may use blank nodes but should use URI’s. Must use URI’s if it is dereferenced according to API. ","Dave: Clarify when one should make up a URI? Eg if there is a practice for creating a URI then one should create it, but do not just make one up out of thin air.",Jamie: Why does one want to use a blank node?,Rob: If there is not a stable ID in content management system. Then it means artificially creating one that is reproducible across changing content management systems. Question from Ethan arose out of not wanting to store all the created URI’s. ,Thanasis: In CRM to get from one entity to another may have to jump through a number of extra entities. So one would have create extra nodes.,Rob: Guidance for this - should it be an implementation note? ,Dave: Error on the side of implementation note.,#202 Allow language based content negotiation.,Rob: French/English example. Only wanting French but take English if no French. ,"Rob: Should not prevent, but no reason to call it out. Antoine says could note the possibility not do not recommend a best practice.","Dave: Concern about the size of response? A lot of not typically used languages may discard the results. May get header sent without user realizing it, need to be cognizant if wants all languages. Can there be a wildcard on except language?",Rob: Implicit “everything else” default.,"Dave: THis may exclude all except one example (ie only US-English in a US search, would exclude other languages that the user may have wanted).",Bree: Different resources in countries with two or more languages and parts of the population only speak one (Finland example). Gives different results based.,Rob: Problematic when one does not return results in another language. Another problem if browser cannot swap languages. ,Jamie: Not done in server. Example where a user does not get anything should not be the case.,"Rob: Troublesome case is when one asks for something and it is not available, does one get nothing or something else?","Dave: Concern about not saying “do not do this” is one would miss out on substantial portion of graph because of excluding languages. However, could be a useful API feature. Could be misleading if one does not realize this at the beginning of implementation.",Rob: In the absence of select language header then it should return all data it has access to.,Dave: Could be confusing. Need to say in spec “ignore language header”. Casual user will only see language set in browser. Is that a problem?,Rob: Does seem like a problem. It is data to be rendered. Normal user actively browsing JSON-LD is low. Downside is size. Ignore except language would return same data in multiple languages. ,Dave: May have to create another standard in order to reduce number of languages in the response. URL would be different and explicitly filtering on another language in this casae so it is obvious in this case. And not the canonical URI.,Rob: If “except language” is absent (probably the default case) then return all languages and allow client to sort it out. If present then return based on preferences.,So can ask for everything or if one is aware,#205 API versioning approach,"Rob: Could use same versioning approach as IIIF.  Major, Minor, Patch system.",Dave: That is not efficient. Kiosk scenario from github. Do not want to pay vendor to revise kiosk in every version of Linked Art.,Rob: Requirement for media type. ,Dave: Most would be programmatic so could use this header. Caveat is would have to get into habit of setting headers.,Rob: Version 3 of IIIF example. Could specify version from the same URI and would return correct version. ,Use semantic versioning and version based content negotiation to manage cross version software incorporation.,Adjourn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exhibition modeling was tackled on the second day (major topic of this f2f meeting), based on many use cases from MoMA. Activity of putting on the exhibition, concept of the exhibition (important bc activities dont have subjects), planning documents (checklists…).

What if the person looking at the language of the label does not speak that language? They would still need to dereference the URI.,The question is do we want to have multiple labels available? Would anyone use this functionality? Rob thinks it might be overkill and that we should have a rule about not having multiple labels. Dave B agrees. Sami: no use case at Newfields for multiple labels.,“_label” with the underscore is intended to convey that it is not data. ,"Named but unidentified actorshttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/246 ",How to document how to describe un-identified actors.,Use case: we know that someone called Yan van de velde has created many items but there are 3 creators with the same name. Option 1: Create an unidentified Yan van de velde which returns many undifferentiated results so unsatisfying. Option 2: create a group that represents a set of people but that’s a bit strange from ontology pov bc we could have a group with 1 person. ,Suggestion: Create an unidentified group of describable people.,"Use case: want to know all works made in the 16th century.

Which suggests that some kind of content negotiation should take place here. Are web standards / technologies sufficiently developed that we can offer this?

More than 100 registrations (~50% attendance). Mostly from Europe. Good session recidivism rate.,"Mapping exercise (with short notice of the object to be mapped) went smoothly, perhaps due to previous experience in this from calls.

As freetext not structured. Also condition types.","Rob - Model already has event in Provenance that could be expanded to cover condition events. Baseline version would be Encounter, could be used for inventory taking or condition report",George - Using Encounter possible but should Conservation Event be in their own wrapper.,Rob - Encounter fairly broad - “This actor was in this location at this point in time”,Joe - Would need to add to that is it deliberate (purpose of encounter) and physical interaction (type of encounter). ,Thanasis - Would need to be activity as intention is part of the condition check ,George - Scope note mentions intentionality ,Thanasis - That’s not quite same as condition checking.,George - Observation class might be an alternative,Kevin - Confusion of meaning of condition checking,Joe - Condition checking covers a variety of possibilities and degrees to the extent of the condition check,Rob - Lots of nuance to condition checking.,Kevin - Assessment versus comparison to existing condition record,"Joe - Depends, can be to confirm existing damage hasn’t changed, or to identify new damage. Some place require condition checking in isolation and then comparison afterwards (to last assessment)",Thanasis - Should be part of the object model,"Rob - Not sure if should be directly in object, part of conservation activity wrapper. Otherwise the object record gets too large over time.","Rob - Could be top level type. Seems tied to provenance, as often related to moves, but not always.",Kevin - Would just need to document people get Provenance and Condition separately ,"George - Registrars need to know where object is. If we have one wrapper for Provenance and another one for Conservation, harder to get the comprehensive picture (would need to merge the data)",Thanasis - Conservation records would not include move of object around the institution,"Joe - Agree, that type of movement not part of conservation, but also not sure if it’s part of provenance either. If an object is moved after 150 years in one place, which results in some fundamental change. That movement is not provenance or conservation, more administrative. Movement could be driven by multiple purposes.","Kevin - All the data is there, would just need to be combined by someone using the API",Joe - Useful to clarify to users of the API that linkage can be made between different part of the model,…,Joe - How do we model time. The present state of knowledge (Condition) becomes historical knowledge (Provenance),Rob - Phases an option but have avoided so far. Wikidata has tried to solve this through structured properties. ,Joe - Trickier in Linked Art API. A Condition event over time becomes a Provenance Event.,Kevin - Need to document that all movement events need to be assembled together,Joe - Can the same event be provided by two APIs at the same time. ,Environmental Requirements & Hazardous materials,Would need text setting out optimal conditions that object should be kept in and text setting out hazardous materials and treatment,"Joe - Tricky. If you want to setup an exhibition on a group of objects, the data in structured form would be most useful to see the range of environmental conditions needed for an exhibition as a whole. For example if one object has much lower lighting conditions required than others, it has series of consequences for exhibition planning.",Thanasis - Agree but requires further work to model this. Trying to describe this would require Event Templates from CRM ,Kevin - Should some of these things be more prominent e.g. hazardous materials,"George - Could take a incremental approach, start with freetext description fields but plan later on to add structured fields.",Joe - Plans afoot to improve these things in collections management systems. Wanting to avoid setting a limited form of this in stone in the data model preventing us from expanding it in the future.,Homework,  For next call ???,Thanasis to create issues for the individual items and attempt to progress with fleshing solutions for easier decision in a following meeting.,  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And will switch Wednesday call to the conference technology. Worth it to run through mapping technology for the conference call? ,"Rob: For Monday session (done before) straightforward, tombstone with expanding to provenance. Don’t want to scare off at first session. So Signet ring or Rijksmuseum object. Replay the mapping of the Stieglitz photograph. Edward is ok with that.","Emmanuelle: Question if Wednesday is still open? More data modelling on Wed? Kevin: Same time as Wed call. Emmanuelle, risk of proceeding as too technical for people exposed to LA for first time. Modelling on the fly is very powerful. Demystifies the work. ","Kevin: Can consider the Wed call at the mapping call or email offline. Rob some agenda is good. Intros may take time. Emmanuelle: we have four sessions so they could be time. As for Thursday, formal paper presentation. Any more thoughts? Kevin: B/c only an hour maybe slightly less presentation driven? Emmanuelle: CIDOC attracts early career practitioners. There is a paper that will be published by conference organizers. Kevin: Have a look via email about V&A presentations and DH presentations that did not happen. Can be adapted. Emmanuelle will get back to organizers about the details for each session.",Issue 311 Image rights,Dave: Common statements that can be used across collections. Rob: and types of objects. ,Rob: Text we have covered. Structured data form (We may not need). ,"In diagram CCBi. Usage rights not generic, has to be specific. Rights “E30” do not have many properties. Some attempt to move forward. Could refer to statement just as text (does not refer to the object). Antoine: (statements not linguistic object). Rightsstatements.org, two patterns. Standard statement eg CCBi. Oddity of having a type link between a specific and a more general. Use W3C recommendation but semantics are different. Statements could be standard CC statement or more complicated. Felt that it was a departure from current rights statement procedure. ","Rob: Is CRM pattern under a rights statement. Antoine: 99% will look different and be more complex. Exploited loophole b/c rights statements are generic things. Standardized like CCBI or statements “no copyright, no date”. Could be more than two levels. Super statement from complex statements. Talking about digital images with complex copyright and IP, hard to model but need to keep door open. ","Rob: Extra complexity for blank node in rights data. Not incorrect just obnoxious. Antoine, may not be incorrect, just a statement.","Rob: What about treating it as a standardized statement (more obnoxious?). Antoine: Depends on use cases, strange to consider “no copyright, no commercial” as a linguistic object. Rob: Should be the page not the concept. ","Rob: If consider CCBi, with text following. Not ideal but best we can do? Dave: Linguistic object or URI? Rob: Image is subject to E30 right, and right is classified by license. No text to display. Dave: That would work for aggregation, but in the case of one with a tighter rights control would need a way to provide actual text of the restrictions. Eg internal use (Exhibition objects, and need to contact a specific person for publication). There may be details to convey for the full idea. ",Antoine: Good example for CRM pattern. Extra nodes to convey. More complex pattern may work. COuld be a landing page or SKOS node. Would a linguistic object or document. May give us a unified pattern for complex statements or statements with textual nodes. ,Rob: This is a reason for going the more complex route. Get this option. ,Antoine: Should we keep the simplest pattern for the simple cases? Dave: Other cases showing both cases to unify data and the querying behind it.

Is it possible for anyone to join?,George: I don’t think it’s necessary to register. It’s not a closed group. Just let me know by email.,Modelling,Issue 364,Rob: this concerns buyers and sellers both having agents in a provenance event. For example: current owner employs someone to go to the auction house and sell something on his behalf; the seller employs someone to go to the auction house and buy the item. The net result is simply that the item transfers ownership between buyer and seller.,Rob: the Getty does have considerable information relating to this. Does anyone else?,"Emmanuelle: certainly the YCBA doesn’t, officially. The reason is that it’s really hard to know when agents acted in official roles. Which is not well documented for obvious reasons. It’s rare to come by source data for that type of scenario. As I hear from my curators.",John: it’s hard to have the definite proof. Assumptions can be made from auction catalogues. You can see the sale in a catalogue and then perceive that the item shows up in someone’s collection and then infer the relationship between the owner and the (agent) buyer.,Joe: do we need a specific pattern for this? What about a nest aspect?,"Rob: provenance activities are already partitioned into different components. If we wanted to express this degree of precision, I think the model might work, however it might be very gnarly. It may not be worth documenting this level of complexity.",Joe: a straight chain might mean that most software loses the data along the way.,"Rob: X object is transferred from B to A. This is already a gross simplification of what is happening. We could easily partition this up if we had greater granularity of activities, but this is not how it’s done in CRM.",George: we should raise this conversation with the SIG. Changing the range of acquisition from physical-thing to a right would be a breaking change (and a big problem). But that doesn’t mean that the early modelling choice was the best one; and does not preclude the invention of a (or more) superclass to handle data which is being created/surfaced by groups like Linked Art.,Rob: flag as Raise to SIG? Put it on the docket for a future (not this week’s) agenda? For now leave as out-of-scope.,George: seems sensible.,"Joe: +1. Is there a way to cheat? I have a relationship here, which is more fully described in this long chain. You have the short sale A-B, satisfying the simple use case. But then nest all the complex in-between transfers A-C-D-E-F-B, etc. Therefore someone with the data can start modelling before SIG resolves pattern.",John: One Frick example sourced from the cat raisonne: https://arcade.nyarc.org/record=b1604647~S7,One more that we are sourcing from the auction catalog. https://arcade.nyarc.org/record=b1576701~S7,"Rob: re: John’s point, it’s hard to get to actual evidence for these events. We can model them, we don’t need additional ontology or docs. But we don’t know for sure that A1 was acting on behalf of A.",Rob: raise Rights Transfer issue to the SIG. The issue of being uncertain about the activities being performed is just a lack of knowledge about the agents (potentially) involved that we can’t deal with.,Issue 366,"Rob: adding to and removing things from collections. This comes up in Exhibitions, as Dave notes. The Set of objects that is the collection (auction lot, or set managed by institution, or set in exhibition). If we want to track the activities causing objects to be added or subtracted from these collections, then we need somewhere to manage that activity. Three possibles:",On the object (all add and removes are on the object),In the collection,Separate (a new top level activity which is only the manipulation of things into sets; potentially could be a Provenance activity),Joe: how does this relate to the general concept of Groups?,"Rob: I think it’s exactly that. If Rob joined Yale on September 21st. Is that part of Rob or part of Yale? If it’s part of Yale, there’s going to be a lot of those. But if it’s part of Rob, it will include all the various groups he has joined.",Jonathan: seems to me that this should be at the Group level. We can presume the join/exit dates from the exhibition. We only need to record the exceptions.,Rob: (channelling Dave) if the connection is on the object and the object is not managed by the institution that is putting on the exhibition then we would not be able to create the link in the context of the exhibition. If I wanted to make Rob’s favourite objects from around the world…,[Edward lost connection for two minutes],Emmanuelle: you will not find any not-fully-accessioned objects on the YCBA website. We do not record presence of long-term loans.,"Joe: we do have long term loans. We have information about exhibitions which have come to us. We have paintings in Japan, so we don’t necessarily have control of the list of objects our paintings have joined.","Richard: we do sometimes put loan objects online but not exhibition loans. When we are loaning to another institution, we do say that it is on loan and where.","Rob: for Exhibitions, this seems like the membership / participation of an object in an exhibition is subtly different to the addition of an object to the Set. Saying that the object was in an Exhibition seems like a useful thing to be able to say. But it seems presumptuous to say that there was an activity adding my object to an exhibiting curator’s Set that they made a choice to do this. The distinction: great if objects can record their provenance, including participation in exhibitions. But if there’s a reason to be more specific about an activity that added an object into a set, then it’s the Collection’s responsibility for recording that.","Joe: if you were using this data and queried a graph for an object, what data would you want back when you fetch its provenance? First question: where do we record this data. Second: where do we present it? How does the user get to that? How is it expressed?",Rob: would be useful to have these links from the objects to the exhibitions but not necessarily the activity by which they were added.,Richard: trying to split in my mind the difference between workflow (movement of objects) and provenance. The fact an object was in an exhibition was true. But because it replaced another one because it is light-sensitive is also true.,"Jonathan: yes, lots of researchers are interested in this. Especially if a work was removed early. Agree that the provenance event is: the work was in the show.",Joe: where would you record the fact that four of the objects in the exhibition need to be covered on Thursdays? Intermediate events that haven’t involved the moving of the object.,"Jonathan: do not believe that this is data that we store in the system. Conservation does manage this type of thing, but we do not make collections system data like this available.",Joe: is this linked conservation data?,Thanasis: two things: One: the plan that you need to cover the thing every week. Then you have the record of whether the thing has been covered. Have not yet dealt in detail with this in Linked Conservation Data but we should do soon.,Joe: total light (rather than lux level) allowances are starting to be recorded. So data is going to exist. But can we model a more generic level?,Thanasis: Activity Plans will definitely cover that sort of thing. This is a different question to whether an object was part of a Set.,"Rob: Richard captured it well distinguishing between workflow and provenance. These things are tied together but distinct. If we need to document the action that adds/removes an object from a Set then it goes on the Set. Otherwise, responsible by the object.",Issue 362,"Rob: in order to render a web page, it would be useful to have a Linked Art based summary of an entity that doesn’t have all of the information but a subset instead. This then would be a separate API interaction, rather than about all of the knowledge. Use cases are around result sets and summaries. Showing a quick card of the object rather than a multi-page thing. Plus ones from Dave and Ethan. This is also related to search. Having the set of fields which could be exposed for the minimum representation of the object would be useful.","Joe: wondering if you want to think of Templates here. This is a use case of pulling back a painting/image/whatever else. Request all of the data, but push it through a template or filter. This allows generic implementations rather than many unique API endpoints.","Rob: API design-wise, having alternate representations of resources is something that lots of info systems have: formats, subsets. Can be client or server side and there are good examples of both. Impossible to get this right for every particular case.

Welcome to do a presentation if you are doing work on Linked Art or semantics.","Also, Linked Art community, as part of its work has always documented itself. George has been working on systems to create more analytic documentation to note the patterns that we are producing and give them identifiers and names. Can we slice down to the “building blocks” that are declared good by the community. Creating a data infrastructure for this and sorting the information. Also working on another document that has this level of granularity. Once it becomes more solid, can be presented here and discuss if this is a good path and strategies for naming the patterns. Documentation on site has dual levels, generic and models. This would take it down one more level, so one could use pieces to construct models according to Linked Art verified/approved patterns. It could support efforts from people coming at different angles or different software. ",Rob: Not to replace existing documentation with automatically generated documentations. But to extend and have more a specification approach. More use case and model driven. Gives an interesting tool to see how we already use the construction. Can determine extent of future changes.,Richard: Collections Trust UK link added to chat.,Rob: There is a good presentation about decolonizing the database.,"Cultural Sensitivity Fieldshttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/355 Question: How to model the flag as data, rather than a statement?",Introduced by Richard.,Question for Linked Art: How should the URI be modeled? Statement would be straightforward. Is “Culturally Sensitive” a classification of the object? Or something else. ,Kevin: Raising licensing quality should be avoided? And how much is related to the object and how much to the labelling?,Richard: Mostly used now for Outdated terminology. If repeated in then flagged again. Images can be flagged separately if the image is sensitive but the object is not. ,Chris: Objects themselves could be sensitive and could be tagged. Richard: Work on that will likely start up after return of curators.,Rob: Yale is beginning to look a bias and racism so this could be important.,"Kevin: This is a large field, so beginning activities included in the proposal. Talking with V&A about possible collaborative project. Pitt-Rivers has a labelling project.","The act of flagging is important, not the note at the end of it. Discerning between the flags may be too much work. ","George: This seems to be part of CRM phases? These are classifications from the stand point of now. And values can change. Almost certainly need an event, if not a phase, for the assigning of value. ",Rob: So attribute assignment on the object. Assigns “sacred” as a type to the object?,"George: Yes, social status. It is a function. ","See Antoine’s chat comment: yes what I’ve heard about these issues (rightsstatements.org wants to work on this) is about access so enabling what Yer says, independently from a specific UI implementation.",@Rob in principle all (most?) of TK is about the digital material and access to it. Though I guess it could also apply to the original material (in a physical exhibition space for example),Rob: Could be applied to digital or physical if needed.,Antoine: Choose to focus on digital because of access. May reflect on original but not always the case. Flag indirectly refers back to the object. So good to keep the option open. ,Rob: Limited number of URI’s (18). Should implementation recognize this URI’s or do we need a metatype “cultural sensitivity flag”.,Anotine: Use TK as first example. Richard: TK dealing with particular set of circumstances not solving all problems.,Rob: So then we would want a metatype on the flag. Or on the attribute assignment?. More consistent would be the metatype. ,Kevin: Capturing the event of the flag occurring is crucial and should be in the data.,Rob: Should it be separate from the object it is assigned to? Is it it’s own model that can be applied across institutions?,"Kevin: Need to capture that the choice was made, who undertook the act. ","Rob: Think we get that from attributed assignment: carried out by, timespans etc. Dimensions as a comparison (who did the measuring).",Justified this as an attribute assignment.,George: This is a pattern we would want to document as in theory applicable to any part of the model? Rob: Visual and textual can definitely be problematic.,"George: As a general pattern, should it apply across the model?","Rob: Can a person be culturally sensitive. George: A group, yes. A person could be sensitive. ",Chris: Question of stereotype on person?,George: Example from Canada. 1st PM MacDonald terrible policies with indigenous peoples so now a culturally sensitive person.,Rob: Places can be sensitive. Provenance can be sensitive.,"Name of object inscribed on parthttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/359 Just duplicate information?",Edward: Did exercise thinking about the attribute assignment about the writing of the title on the back. ,Rob: SOmeone would have done some exercise in naming or labelling. ,Edward: Do we have to know the act in order to model the attribute assignment.,Yer: Title type as inscribed so this is part.,Rob: In Getty there is classification of the name if it is on the object.,"Where the name of the object is important. We do not want to refer to the name outside of the object record. This is nice if the part is separate from the whole. The name is carried by the part of the object. Could apply to other things, eg signature. Least change to what we have now. Add property to “names”. ",George: Eloquent. Possible b/c E44 and E31.,Emmanuelle: There could be confusion. On backs of paintings there could be many labels with different titles. Some of these labels might be from exhibitions.,Rob: Other options: Make name its own resource. Problematic because everything is name. Not important that name is text. Back can carry the name separate from title. ,Attribute assignment way is difficult b/c do not know much about the actual assignment and conflicts with the exhibition case. ,"Emmanuelle: Concern about not being able to retrieve all titles, including the titles crafted for the purpose of exhibitions, when querying for titles. ",Rob: need to write up exhibition cases. And see how easy it is to get from one to the other.,So allowed carried by to refer to the physical object that carries the name.,"Agents for buyers and sellers in provenancehttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/364 Too complex/lack of data to be in scope?",Rob: Came up in Getty provenance work.Transaction with both buyer and seller have their own agents. Do not know what agent worked for whom. Also do not know if there was any custody for the agents.,It would be a lot of effort if we were to do this everywhere. Would have to change provenance structure to allow further partitioning. Would have to be included for all provenance activities.,Examples in issue informative.,Is it too complicated at this point? Can always defer.,Chris: really a separate study. Is the labelling good enough for querying different roles?,Richard: Don’t really have this in object record?,Rob: Not really in Yale? ,Emmanuelle: Paul Mellon did have agents. ,Rob: Come back and think about ways that this would not be too complicated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Offered time and what we can benefit from?,"Emmanuelle: all online and totally free. We have put in for four different time slots. Roughly everyday 4pm Geneva time. Four types of things to achieve: 1 LA meet as a working group (Monday). 2 Workshop hoping to be joint session between Linked Art and CRM (Wednesday) 3 Panel (Thursday). 4 More technical discussion b/tw LA and CRM working group (Tuesday, could happen Wednesday).","George: Vision for Monday session is not a workshop, more an introduction. Thanasis: Monday could be more like London with people bringing in data and creating models. ",Thanasis: Meeting tomorrow and will bring up schedule. CRM and LA issues discussion Wednesday. Workshop on Monday in the late session. Question is to filling up the hour on Tuesday.,"Kevin: replication of London event online will need big chunks of time, probably not right for CIDOC. What we do on the modelling calls on Wednesday could be done in an hour. Is that the right way to go forward?",Rob: Sounds right ending agreement from conference. Tuesday could be given back to organizers or could be another workshop. Discussion Wed. Panel Thursday. ,Kevin: Flexibility because of modelling calls on alt Wednesdays. And there could be benefits for CIDOC attendees to see. ,Rob: Monday as “performance art”. Tuesday as drop in modelling.,"George: usual plan Monday is intensive interaction semantics. The other session is more like advertising, get in touch with working group (less intensive). Dependent on virtual performance. Monday attendees to CRM should have basic lingo in head and then if interested look into Linked Art. ",Issues:,"Position of inscriptionshttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/348Discuss relative positioning of carried content - out of scope beyond a note?",Rob: If knowing where the inscription is how do we present that in structured data? ,Dave: Location info in inscriptions/marks is in text. “Lower left corner”. Not normalized. IIIF images of inscriptions could be included? ,Rob: Detail image would work nicely with structured data. Carries inscriptions and has representation of the detail of the object. ,Dave/John multiple terms to represent the same quadrant. Same with any vocabulary.,Thanasis: Areas on painting by quadrants could be places not locations?,Dave: Structured form usefulness as opposed to an aide.,Thanasis: Conservation POV annotate from photograph rather than using words. Probably doesn’t apply to signatures. ,Rob: 3D images makes it much more complicated. ,Richard: Provided example in chat. Same type of location info. In Marks and Inscriptions field. Cataloging completeness can vary.,Rob: Are there sufficient usecases for creating a physical part? Maybe with a separate image of the inscription. Material could be interesting too “signed in ink” on a watercolor.,Thanasis: Partitioning should not be a problem for creation of part. Capacity for having separate material is useful.,Dave: Do we want to require expression of data in both ways when more detailed expression is available? ,Rob: Valuable to have both. Because gives easy way to render content to a human. And if there are research questions that arise that query can be run. ,Dave: Also for computer readability. ,"Object State specific dimensionshttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/251","Rob: Linked Art and Linked Conservation with its more scientific focus. Want to have ability to record dimensions as well as how the dimensions were obtained. Allows us to put more properties on. Eg Curator, ruler. ","We have ability to measure, but do not have a pattern for measuring while an object is in a particular state. Could add property “technique’ that refers to some state of the object. Eg box while open. Technique =  box while open. Unframed, etc.",More complicated when dealing with parts. Overall state of the object gives flexibility for vocabulary term to be used across institutions. ,"Other proposal would be multiple types. Put on the dimension. Or using state (open, closed). That requires having states which is something we are trying to avoid. ",Thanasis: If wanting to compare height without frame you would have to go through attribution assignment technique. For with/without frame. Is there real advantage. ,Rob: One issue no “openness” Widthness works but could not match on “open”.,George: Advantage of attribute assignment is there is a problem with grouping dimensions. Attribute assignment lets you say it is “open” even if not knowing agent or time. Can group together which is useful. ,Issue of Time based media. (Thanks Karina!).,Thanasis: Attribute assignment gives more flexibility. Good solution.,Rob: This would be just one more field to something we will use quite often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We've not discussed others,7 requirements,3 patterns.,First pattern (full) fails requirement 7,Simpler meets all requirements,Baseline fails at several requirements,So Simpler seems the way to go.,Joe: what sits under these nodes? URIs for which more info is available?,Rob: Person and Visual Work are individual derefenceable resources. Identifier wouldn't be.,Joe: the content is not resolvable. Would the Complex pattern have the URI elsewhere? Combination of the Full and the Simpler?,Rob: yes identifier as string vs identifier as URI,We can do Full + Simpler and the documentation would state how to handle the options,Joe: what type of thing is 'painting.jpg'. The info is not present,Rob: the info would come from the fact the link from Digital Object,The other option would be to have a stub report about the URL. But then we could smush this record in Baseline.,But then we lose the possibility to have consistent resources.,Joe: someone building software on the data would need to know,Kevin: the question is what is the capability on the other end.,Rob: distinction between a representation (giving back pixels) and a service (giving back a description),Kevin: IIIF is a good example,Rob: the other rationale for having DO as a base entity is that we can apply other patterns to it.,Joe: how about derivatives?,Rob: out of scope,Joe: DO1 and DO2 related to the same object. To allow the basic model to state that this concept is possible would be good.,Rob: could you create an issue?,"Joe: I don't think we need to fully do it, but if we come with a model to link to DOs, it would be good to indicate that more is possible (but stop here).",Kevin: rights could be added as a requirement,Joe: rights management could be delegated to services,"Antoine, Kevin: it's about the status not the management",Joe: agreed,Rob: what kind of info would we like to have for a DO?,Antoine: slippery slope.

Could be interesting to search for.",Dave: what about set of images (e.g. sets that provide a 360 view of an object or a set of audio recording that represent a set of lectures). Would we rely on a IIIF manifest for this?,Rob: a link to a set. Links to individual resources. Or partitive relationship.,Antoine: at Europeana we've thought of hierarchical object (thus part of),"Joe: It contains bugs, but is this useful: https://jpadfield.github.io/cidoc-crm.examples/models/mermaid_imageexam.html","Rob: Europeana uses ""has service"" to link to, we could do the same",Joe: what's the service? Returning a jpeg or a manifest?,Rob: https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#service ,Joe: would we say that the image is included in the manifest?,Rob: we'd leave it for further elaboration,Rob: for the ??? I don't think there is a specific property in CIDOC CRM,Antoine: how about using the URL as the identifier of the DO,Rob: this would require content negotiation,Antoine: we do consider that they are in kind of records,Joe: there could be several DOs?,Antoine: yes,Rob: I see the point but the amount of data to be transcluded would be too high.

There is a bidding activity, can put a type of final price on it. Can have payment eg the commission from owner to auction house.

Can transfer custody in the “normal” case. Raise to the SIG for legal not physical custody eg Ebay. Assign custody to sell through photograph. ,Antoine: most can be solved by taking out the word physical. ,George should be in P2 but it is clear for physical.,		Sale with photograph,		Black market,		Immovable,		Performance art,		Born digital,		,275,Do we create an event or is the transfer of custody sand alone,Provenance event subtype with interesting event and filled in with notes relating to that event.,On diagram Event=purchase at auction because that is the event we are caring about.,Nicola could fix vocabulary to explain the event,Rob a lot times the nodes are not known or not published. There is always one event and if one wants to publish the payment then good. Works for the provenance with different departments as well.,Nicola the timespan is a problem when attached to the entire event. ,"Rob General classifications go on the top event. Can sub events have types, yes. But not the same as parent they should be more specific. Timespan of the event is the maximum of all of its parts, not required. Sub events timespans should be recorded. Should timespan on the top one can be inferred onto the sub events?

Could but not necessary.,"George: If thought there would be more information that would extend the timespan, so not sure about outer bounds and could have another instance with only knowing a vagueness. This could be a note.

",Class as exchange. ,Antoine: need to include a class that is useful for the provenance event. ,George higher level of CRM activities would make us find what is common to all provenance activities. ,Antoine can have activities independent of a wrapper?,Rob: Wrapper is not a big cost versus having multiple patterns. Wrapper allows 1 for consistency in API and 2 we do not know the causal relationships,There is a large vocabulary that could exist in Purchase but this may be better as type of provenance event. ,George scope note for provenance event so it is known when to apply it? CRM move from storage to gallery is different than from one museum to another. ,"Antoine: Production and destruction are excluded. Only exchanges. Rob: It’s the events in the life span of a piece of art. Production and destruction are one to one, not needed on the API level.

Want a one to one between the nodes and the real world.,Adam: always have to decide how many creation events that is not a reason to subdivide.,Nicola: No other solution except to put in PC14,George: Always create a broad event and then fill in what is known is fine (one possibility). ,No to requiring the split. ,285 Ariadne compliant archaeological find model,Add S19 and O19 to Linked Art context,"George valid data but where should it be recorded.

Needs to be possible.",Antoine: Reality is there are some entities where there is no value in linking.,"Kevin: If you have data (whether you’re the only one with that data or not), you will want to and should be able to publish your data.","Adam: Cost will get very high to publish all data, including that which may not have value or is handled by others.",Rob: Going back to Antoine’s question - I would question that there is actually a use case where you wouldn’t want to go to a URI to get info.,Antoine: But the question is SHOULD you always mint a URI for these entities? You may then become the defacto authority responsible for that entity.,"Rob: But without URIs for key entities, we lose the wrapper for our data.","Ethan: But if you have two John Smiths, distinct entities, and you know nothing else about them, then minting distinct URIs will accomplish something - disambiguates the two, lacking no other info.","Antoine: but it could be that the John Smiths in your case were actually the same, you didn't know.","Adam: But two blank notes doesn’t indicate that those two John Smiths ARE the same, just that you know the names and they happen to be the same.",Kevin: The issue is whether as an institution you are able to maintain the URIs that you put out there. It is a policy issue of which entities you wish to maintain.,"Adam: Worth saying, “here’s the costs of these practices”. Initial cost to implement URIs is low, but grows over time with maintenance.",[discussion of blank nodes vs. institutional URIs],George: blank nodes --> can’t point to that thing now or at a later time.,General point: can’t encode authority.,"Antoine: Something to ask institutions: if all you have is a name, is it worth minting and maintaining a URI? A bridge too far.",Rob: Let’s create a list of top level entities that would require creating URIs.,"Human Made Object (ours - NOT exhibitions, depictions)","People (except external authorities, e.g. VIAF, ULAN)","Group (except external authorities, e.g., VIAF, ULAN)","Place (except external authorities, e.g., TGN)","Collection/set (actual collection itself, not the members of it)",Provenance Event,Visual content (except external authorities),Textual content (except external bibliographic authorities),Digital Object,Event/Period (except external authorities),Exhibition,Sami: how about when you're publishing an exhibition list and it's not your objects? (qualifier added to HMO above),Adam: Creating URIs and making statements about them requires clean data.,"Rob: [summarizing above list] - If in the data you encounter a URI that identifies a Person, Place, Group, Place, Textual content, then you should expect that at the other end it may not necessarily be Linked Art (likely use of external authorities. For HMOs, Collection/Set, Provenance Event, Visual Content, Digital Object, Event/Period, or Exhibition, you SHOULD expect to get Linked Art (though there will be exceptions).","Rob: When you dereference a LA URI for certain entities, within the returned JSON you would publish other identifiers from external resources.","Athanasios: So, if you have a link to an external authority, you will always get there going through Linked Art.","Antoine: Possibly problematic wording. Future proof our language - we’re saying you will get Linked Art, but should be “you SHOULD expect to be able to get Linked Art”.","Antoine: Question - the links to external resources - are we saying these links should be present in the LA presentation that is dereferenced from the URI? Is it only accessible from dereferencing, or available in the main document. So we're trying to control the verbosity of the ""main records""?","Rob: Example - within a Production Event, the carried out by statement would only include the URI, type, and label. Avoid verbosity, as the document for that entity that carried out the production would provide the full information.",David: Question about mechanisms/syntax for referencing external identifiers,Kevin: Implementation choice of whether/where you use an external identifier vs. internal.,"Antoine: Why not use directly the recommended identifier (e.g., ULAN) instead of using the internal identifier, if you’re ultimately recommending that the external is the preferred?",Dave: could be a case of an internal identifier that we prefer other people to use as reference.,"Rob: Using both says - don’t use OUR identifier for reconciling, use the external identifier for reconciliation.",Rob: [reiterates summary of top level entities listed above],Adam: So this will be specified in the documentation - that implementations SHOULD publish LA for certain entity types.,Antoine: And your LA would reference other identifiers.,"Rob: If you have something to say about the entity. If you don’t have anything to say, would use the external identifier directly.",David: Should you drop the Type assertion on an external identifier?,Answer: No.,Rob: Simple case - script to transform source data to JSON-LD; system that handles content negotiation,"Rob: When there are multiple representations (less simple case), the client needs to know how to request a specific format",Adam: Would like to see “shoulds” become “mays” in the documentation,"Kevin: Scenario: your institution already has a URI, do you put that into your LA JSON-LD, or do you use that URI and via content negotiation LA JSON-LD or other return can be requested?",Answer: Both are options.,"Rob: If there are other avoidances that we want to associate with URI, it would be much trickier within the content negotiation case than otherwise. Example: structuring a request to return all incoming references to the URI instead of returning outgoing.",Rob: Should we recommend a form of URI? No.,Sami: some recipes on structuring URIs could be useful for some implementers.,"Rob: Probably shouldn’t use a blank node, but how about a non-dereferencable identifier (i.e., UUID)",General: As long as the UUID is stable.,George: Need consistency in identifiers. Maintain a consistent method to produce these identifiers.,Antoine: But the John Smith example from before could end up with the same hash.,Adam: How many qualities/pieces of information should you have to publish a URI or other unique identifier that would require maintenance?,"Antoine: Return to my refusal to identify these things when there isn’t information or valuable information. In those cases, if the person has no identity outside of the context of that object, what about using a URI like .../object/person",Richard: But most institutions have system identifiers for person entities.,Antoine/George: Not all,"Antoine: If LA requires identifiers, it should be simple to mint them, even for institutions that may not have system identifiers. Prefer blank nodes, but if the URIs must be minted, make it simple to do.",Edward: Does one institution's desire to mint a fragment URI instead of a real one impede a user’s ability to find information about these entities?,"Antoine: When more information is found out, a new more legitimate URI would be minted, and be related to the old one that has been deprecated","Edward: Why have two different practices for minting URIs - whether fragment or direct, if you need a URI do it consistently. CIDOC’s Statement on Linked Data identifiers for museum objects:   http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/cidoc/PDF/StatementOnLinkedDataIdentifiersForMuseumObjects.pdf",Adam: Question is actually whether we have a URI (any URI) or not (blank node).,"David: NGA went with UUIDs, storing them in the CMS, so that data will always go along with all the other data should there be a migration. More sustainable approach than using CMS db identifiers.",Mid-morning session: Content Negotiation,"With clever systems, you can implement a single URI which can return many different representations.",Recent W3C discussions have produced guidelines for implementing content negotiation. Both are viable:,application/ld+json#profile,application/linked-art+ld+json,"IETF have not ruled that profiles should resolve to a particular pattern. However, neither is forbidden.  https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#iana-considerations",The profile parameter is already in use. ,The profile may be being used to describe either the content or the container. Which blurs the situation.,"Another consideration is the ability to register a file type against a profile. We could, therefore, propose a filename pattern and register it so that a browser could automatically handle it. Something like `.lajson` (or whatever).",Dave: do web servers support these application profiles?,Adam: yes; Apache certainly does. Luckily there are strict rules for comparing MIME types.,"Given the possibility that IETF dislike the repeating plus characters, Rob suggests using the hash pattern URI.",Antoine: possibly we should wait for the developing recommendations for application profile (not in media types) in general to conclude? ~ Maybe: https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/ ,Rob: if we want a different syntax but the same structure (Turtle instead of JSON-LD) then there’s a conflict - we would have to use a special header. As Linked Art is a JSON-LD shop then we don’t have to specify.,"Antoine: there’s vagueness between profiles and form which either describes format or content structure. The discussion between the two W3C groups resulted in a nice outcime, ie. JSON-LD ""profiles"" are rather about the ""form"" of the data than its content.","Antoine: relating to the urgency of this -- is Linked Art JSON-LD competing with other forms of JSON-LD in the community at the moment? Can we use /json-ld and wait until there is a conflict? Ethan/Rob: no, we are already using JSON-LD for other data.",Kevin (to Rob): are you going to implement both or one (of these profile choices)? Rob: Getty will implement the group’s recommendation.,"The `#profile` is in the JSON-LD context, but the `+` route does not allow representing Linked Art in other data formats.",Rob: are there other API questions?,Edward: what about the remaining CRUD operations: read/write etc.?,For now the API will just implement GET.,Dave: search?,Adam: discussions often very quickly become blocked by very specific use-cases or data.,Rob: we can always look at these things later after we have implemented GET. Being able to retrieve things is fundamental.,Adam: someone else can provide search; already Ethan can harvest and spider the data.,Adam: is search a required feature for being able to manage the data itself?,Adam: people who do perform aggregation will bring really valuable experience to future discussions relating to search.,"Rob: Getty are working on a change-publication IIIF API as a first step towards building a search API.

It is a problem if the model can’t express the ‘or’ operator because then it seems that the 2 creators collaborated when we are certain that they did not.,Rob: do we just need to make style of a new property?

Same exemplar continues next week.,Joe: have been doing more work on own GitHub system which helps generate Mermaid diagrams from committed models. Would be interested in putting together config for colours and shapes for Linked Art. Currently built from a text file containing a simple set of tab separated triples. https://jpadfield.github.io/simple-modelling/ (docs being built),Rob: Edward and Rob have also been playing around with live-modelling/diagramming Python tooling (see Showcase1 repo),Model issues:,#346: membership of arbitrary sets,All the API responses should be able to have membership of a set resource. Object part of collection. Place part of travel route set. Person part of set of people (as opposed to a Group).,"However, we haven’t really talked about Sets much, and relationship with other entities.",`member_of` is already a CRM property for constituting groups; so we could re-use the term via JSON-LD mapping.,"Thanasis: re: non-physical and physical auction items discussion at Oxford - this felt a little too specific at the time, but Rob’s outline (about) summarises the use cases well. Own opinion is that the semantics need explanations as to why things have been put together.","Rob: mixed physicality sets could be solved with their own class, but this isn’t a case where a Place would be part of the set. This might be too specific. And require reactive modelling to arising use cases.",Thanasis: appreciate that ongoing re-modelling discussions can’t happen too frequently.,"Rob: in the ontology we could note: although the range is an E1, we expect it to be used with E22s (and other entities).

Keywords are often the links software needs to use to connect things.",Rob: in favour of moving forwards with this. There are good use cases for collecting a mix of concepts together in Sets. Would anyone be disappointed if we permitted any Linked Art primary entities being part of a Set?,Joe: the limitation of CIDOC was that you couldn’t combine sets of things.,Rob: CRM doesn’t support our primary use-case of physical and non-physical things.,Thanasis: we need to recognise that a property that connects anything to anything else is not particularly useful for anything deep. But it does cover our use cases very well..,Joe: possible that people will shortcut proper semantics by using Set.,Rob: so we shouldn’t use this as a stand-in for a real relationship.,"Joe: examples will help, showing both Set use and nicely-semantically-describe relations.",Thanasis: don’t want it to be a workaround for complex modelling that you want people to do.,"Kevin: some of these slightly arbitrary Sets are tending towards being out-of-scope, even though the use-cases are well founded.","George: where does this fit into CIDOC-CRM? If it is more or less like a list, ontologically, -- ah it’s a PropositionalObject -- that’s fine, we just need a nice scope note for this. We need to be clear that you wouldn’t use it for a group of people (they have Group).",#357: cause of death,"Rob: people can die, and that’s part of the Person record; but the cause of death is an Event.",Joe: is this only people and not other things? A Group or Organisation could die. Maybe a stretch of the definition but the process is the same. Would this follow this semantic pattern?,"Rob: same relationship applied to the dissolution of the group, or the destruction of the whatever.",?: death of a racehorse? (not getting notified of who is speaking),Rob: CRM is not good at animals. We have tended to stay away from describing living creatures who are not people.,Joe: Titian’s Death of Action (sp.)? Represents event in the painting.,Thanasis: we do have BiologicalObject in the CRM.,Rob: we can declare the cause of the destruction of objects; but we cannot give the cause of death of a person. Death() currently only has time and place.,"Joe: it’s quite common for people to want to describe what materials killed artists: lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, etc. Also see death of Robert Hayden.",Joe: can the Death occur during an event?,"Rob: following the destruction pattern - it was caused by another event. The death did not occur during the stabbing, but the stabbing caused the person to die.","Rob: relatively easy to add cause property with range of another Event entity. The cost isn’t high, but if it’s not going to be useful then we shouldn’t do it.",Joe: unlikely for people to want to model old age as a cause of death.,Edward: relationship is just caused not caused death by?,Rob: Yes,Joe: this pattern could be used for many other things.,"Rob: yes, we use it for the Production of objects too. The Production was caused by commission. Current property is `O13`. I don’t think the cognitive cost for following this pattern is very high; there’s no added cost for understanding. There is a low cost for API and model documentation. Although we don’t have data in big collection management systems, it does seem worth the minimum cost of implementation.",Thanasis: the `caused_by` property looks to be using CRMsci. I think that triggered by applies to events which do not have agency. We should double check if we are using this for events with agency.,Joe: would this mean that a house being burned down because some lava flowed into it - would be compatible with the model; but someone pouring petrol on it and setting alight - would not.,Rob: if it works for events then it should work for activities. It doesn’t say only for use with E5s and not E7s.,Thanasis: there was discussion of this in relation to causality. Causality is hard to prove so we opted to make it more general.,Joe: we could preface all of the properties with is currently believed to…,"Thanasis: intent. Re: chaos theory. There was no intent on the actor’s behalf to cause something; nevertheless, it did happen. The intent was lacking.",Joe: modelling intent then may need additional commentary.,#355: cultural sensitivity fields,Richard: added this to discussion as aware. The very labelling of the topic itself may be a discussion being had also.,"Richard: in light of current events and awarenesses, we are going to be re-cataloguing and marking cultural sensitivity: what and why. At first this may be text, but linked from the issue is a vocabulary for making statements of this kind..",Richard: also data relating to who would have been able to see/interact with an object.,?: At the McCord (sp?) there are objects which need to be covered at night; can only be shown during certain seasons. There is information for this in the acquisition records but not in the ontology.,Rob: there should be a set of controlled values?,"Richard: ideally yes, although we may begin with a textual statement.","Richard: Kevin, maybe say something towards this being rolled into a future project strand?",Joe: Tate looking at extending project funding for implementing further vocabulary detoxing.,?: what about using PROV (from W3C) to record that things were stated at a certain time; rather than continually revisiting the data and bringing into line with current culture.,"Joe: the ability to capture mixed or conflicting beliefs would be wonderful. But if there are objects which have restrictions on use, how can we make this data searchable/usable/findable to a user and not just a historian of the data.","Kevin: we have proposed to AHRC to look at how institutions are approaching this work and examine what is recorded in the data. There’s potentially interesting work here: to try and understand how this maps into institutional mission and whether the data can support it. Then how this is modelled, etc., is complicated.",Rob: we have shied away from modelling how people’s beliefs have changed over time. No one has the data and it becomes very complicated very quickly.,"George: re implementation suggestion comment in issue: P2 is not right; maybe Name Use? This thing was categorised by this curator at this time and it had this now not-kocher-to-use term. Similarly: this other group doesn’t classify things as the curators do, but they consider that it has this other meaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternate Wednesdays in this time slot. Immediate data model with people on this call. Begin with O’Keeffe from October showcase. Can look at the gaps that were hand stitched by Sami. As well as changes in model. Also, should look at transAtlantic connections (Constable or Turner). Need to check back to make sure people are happy their data is used for O’Keeffe model. Sami will reach to get continued approval and/or new data. Second objective of these calls is to try out new technologies like a shared whiteboard over Zoom. ",	2 Linked Art 2 AHRC project. Launch a community outreach call for exemplars. Speculative call for beyond this group. Will be online workshops. Try to have two parts: presentation of LA as it is and break out of focused modelling over Zoom. Hope to do first round late in July and then in September. , 	3 Digital Humanities conference. Physical component cancelled. Will be digital component. LA has a panel accepted. Will go up on Humanities Commons. Can reuse these presentations for outreach workshops.,	4 Funding round “Linked Art 3” AHRC and NEH. Thanks for input. Kevin will put together from the call. ,Emmanuelle: any publishing from DH 2020? Kevin: will go into a book of abstracts (work already done).,Kevin: Trying to coordinate funding with Linked Conservation funding call (done with Thanasis).,Kevin: will put out objectives from Linked Art 3. Delicate balance from co-investigators. Looking for people from cultural heritage institutions to lead those parts of the project. ,"	Jamie: A document to show people would be helpful. Kevin: working on that but also want it to be used more than once. Joe: Subject specialities -  should we included bias? Kevin: happy to include any topic but will need co-investigator who has that as speciality. Ideal strand would be for that knowledge to intersect with an institution interested in developing LA as a technology. Richard: provenance would be doable? There are established people. Kevin: really interested in exploring that, ask your colleagues. Need to talk about provenance of a period or particular material type. Dave: Distribution of collection as to ethnicity. This may ramp up into an actual level of access and this could join LA. Joe: that will likely be the same in other institutions (similar to paintings by women at National Gallery, cannot search now). Kevin: if timing works over the next couple of months, this could be a good focus. ","Jamie: clarifying about provenance, W3C standard for each claim? Kevin: referring to ownership of work of art. Joe: Provenance = Soap opera of art history. ","Kevin: Looking for an individual who comes to mind in an institution who has interest and speciality. Also could be an institutional directive. Joe: What about Getty Provenance project? Rob: left the Getty, and a lot of data cleaning in the background. Joe: what about a curator for subject expertise? ",Model issues:,"Professional Activity vs Professionhttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/351Proposal - Add a metatype to specific professional activities, and keep professional activity as well (c.f. artwork / type of work)","Rob: Should we do same sort of pattern as artwork and type of object. Two types done professionally and what type. Would give all possibilities. Eg Profession architect; architecting without being professional, or profession without knowing what type.","Joe: Would this logic be enough to classify someone as an artist, painter, architect etc.?",Rob: should be enough. ,Joe: Clear understanding as how to query this would be helpful. ,"Rob: Lewis Carroll example, artist/author (among lots of others) this pattern allows for all activities, professional or not. ",Joe: How to get to “Lewis Carroll” from this in LA. ,Rob: {,"  ""type"": ""Person"",","  ""performed"": {","    ""type"": ""Activity"",","    ""classified_as"": [","      {""id"": ""aat:300393177"", ""type"": ""Type"", ""_label"": ""Professional Activities""},","      {""id"": ""aat:300024987"", ""type"": ""Type"", ""_label"": ""Architecting"", ""classified_as"": {""id"": ""aat:type-of-activity"", ""type"": ""Type"", ""_label"": ""Type of Activity""}}",   ],},Philippe: Can use professional activities twice? Rob: Yes. Philippe: query becomes more complicated. Rob: need to know it is professional and architecting.,Joe: How to get from the event (a larger event with multiple people) to the activity?,"Rob: from API point of view, do not have arbitrary activities at top level. Would put the activity under the person. ",Rob: this case is to find all the artists and/or all the collectors and they can be one in the same person. ,Joe: in the case of exhibition how to connect multiple people? Rob: that could be tricky. Dave: relationship with objects? ,"Joe: another model test, person with professional paintings and amateur paintings?",Kevin and Joe: question of large project over time with multiple projects. Complex query to find architects involved in creating National Gallery for example. Rob: could be associated with National Gallery as building not as a project. Joe: do not want to encode the same data multiple times. ,"Bree question of timespan, Rob included in model.",Non specific timespans? First part of century? Rob: all to the second but with fuzziness. Ontology does give flexibility with uncertain timespans. Also can say abstract period of time “Bronze Age” and activity took place in that period without saying when that abstract period is. As long as people know when the abstract period took place.,Rob: Will write up into the person model for double checking. Can cover use cases without stretching anything. ,"Identifier context https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/347",Rob: Objects move around and get identified in different ways by different people. ,Accession number example. 1997 acc number but there is a pre-1997 number. Need to know earlier museum or would have two identical acc numbers in model.,Joe: Identifier assigned by legal entity. Can this be a third party identifier? Rob: Could be a good case. ,Rob: solution is “assigned by”. Based on the id of the museum or other assigner. Lugt number would also fit in here. ,Joe: Multiple acc numbers from one institution? National Gallery exhibition gets x number. Sample gets r number. Long term loan gets L number. Purchased gets NG number. An object could have all those numbers depending on history. ,: Metatype of Accession Number? Rob: May not solve Joe’s question. ,	Rob: Is “general_purpose” enough? Does it give the intent of accession number? ,"Dave: May be more appropriate to record exhibition numbers with exh, not object. Rob: Doesn’t solve long-term loan, ",For artist numbers that is solved on the group level. Question is about multiple numbers from one institution. ,Joe: Makes query harder. Could look for all accession numbers an filter. Dave: History of accession numbers. Rob: History is easier can put a timespan on it. Not for valid but rather for when it was assigned. ,Joe: Case of acc number and Group number. Group numbers also NG numbers. ,	Rob: Is group different physical thing with its own numbers?,Rob: Basic scenario of who assignes acc number this model is good. We did add other features without problems in model. Can we move forward on this? ,Edward’s question about publication. Rob yes: “is_referred_to-by”,"Kevin: Purchase case, is that similar to groups? Sub-division of lots? Maybe use this pattern? Joe’s examples may need to be revisited. The shared acc numbers may not have to be part of LA 1.0, if not very common.",Rob: Will put out agenda earlier. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please complete the form and proffer your thoughts on all the various communication channels.",Richard: is the September plan still valid?,"Chris: The Netherlands has extended its ban on large gatherings until September, but we’re not so numerous for this to be a problem.",Rob: the CIDOC conference will delay September’s Geneva conference until December. So no longer overlapping with London/Amsterdam but now in line with a European IIIF conference.,"Kevin: sit tight, see where things end up. September is admittedly starting to look shaky; anecdotally, some October events are already looking at cancelling.",Model issues,348,Inscriptions and signations.,There is a distinction between a statement about an inscription signature or the inscription/signature itself.,"Rob: we have statements already, but we don’t have documentation explaining how to model the actual signature. There are two approaches:",Have the VisualItem of the work represent the LinguisticObject which is the actual inscription,Have the inscription being carried_by the object itself,"The trade-off is that we can make comments (in #1) about the qualities of the inscription (it’s blue, or tilted); where as (#2) gives fewer affordances.",Michiel: is the carries property already used for artwork-type patterns or only books?,"Rob: not in any of the documentation. So far only for book-like things. I could imagine that a sculpture with a carved inscription or a painting with significant text within the painting, or the words on a building -- all of these things would be text carried by an object. Therefore it’s not going to be uncommon. Although… will museum contributors have the appropriate data in their CMS?",Michiel: what exactly is a VisualItem? Can the VisualItem also carry?,Rob: carries is for the relationship between a physical thing and a textual thing. Whereas represents is more -- what is represented in the visual content. Represents is right here.,Michiel: so a LinguisticObject can be in the range of represents?,Rob: yes. Even non-physical things.,"Joe: if you want to document detail about signature then there are likely issues with simply recording a piece of text. Complexity: multiple signatures, obscured, incomplete, removed, etc. From a conservation point of view, there’s difficulty with it simply being text and a number.",Rob: VisualItem would be beneficial here as the text might be Vinc and the -ent was lost.,Joe: the signature is also a physical thing. It’s made of something.,"Rob: yes, the materials of the paint of the signature would require a physical HMO to represent the signature.",Michiel: if there is a person depicted. You might want to say it’s been done with thick paint. Maybe this is going too far?,Joe: there’s a difference between a depiction of a person (they are not in the painting) but the signature is there.,Rob: Emmanuelle also commented on a date being present. Either of the suggested patterns work for these circumstances. ,"Joe: when a photograph has been taken of the signature, where does it hang?",George: depicts more appropriate than carries for visual but needs to be balanced between pragmatic use of data. Creating VisualItem blank nodes for the sake of good modelling might actually lead to confusion if you never have any claims to make about it. Sometimes this might be better tagged as the aspect of the object.,"Rob: we have tried to avoid shortcuts wherever possible. Given that there are lots of use cases for the visual work part, I would personally prefer not to introduce a shortcut on this.","George: if normally you’d pass this sort of information through the VisualItem, then using P128_carries would be inconsistent.","Emmanuelle: it’s not unusual for new inscriptions to be acquired/discovered, and it’s important to capture them. We might describe the date when an inscription was made based on its materials.","Michiel: labels of auction house, transporters, and so on. These can be affixed to the rear of a painting. Is VisualItem inappropriate for handling all the positional information in this context? ",For example: ,"inscription: “painted in red ink”, position: left bottom side. Inscription has creator. As well as the content of the inscription.","Watermark: type, creator [empty], description: a shield with a crown holding a scimitar (etc. Latin etc.)","Rob: let’s take positioning first. We have found, in conservation, where somethings is/happened is significant. George and Rob have used a polygon, which gets applied to an image which overlays the position of the inscription. We could have the VisualItem represent the inscription and then it could have position.",Michiel: this would add another object: artwork has physical part which has VisualItem.,Rob: physical part is made of blue paint; the VisualItem part has position and description and it represents “Vincent” as text.,Michiel: the parts could then also have materials?,"Rob: yes, this could all go on to the physical part.",Joe: relative physical dimensions?,Rob: we need Thanasis.,Joe: how would you define a panel in an altarpiece? It’s a painting within a sculpture.,"Rob: yes, and then recursive parts: the left panel has whatever characteristics…",Michiel: couldn’t the physical part then just carry this inscription and we do away with the VisualItem?,Rob: visual works have some notion of space and layout but text doesn’t. So you need it for positioning. The altarpiece example is a good one. But describing the nested complexities of it in realtime was too much for the notetaker.,Michel: have asked to share examples from the Van Gogh Museum.

Will move it to September.,Discussion around the funding streams,Karina: question to Kevin about AHRC grant and the question if hiring is on track. Hiring is behind given uni admin is switching focus to covid management. There may be no cost extensions to the projects… but nothing official yet. ,"Rob: haven’t heard anything from us side on next round of funding. There was to be a workshop in april, but this seems unlikely.","Rob: grant making bodies are treating this seriously and compassionately, and there should not be a problem generated out of delays etc.",Update on documentation,Rob has updated the provenance documentation,Rob is starting to write up the API documentation that has been discussed since the Oxford meeting,Call to assistance for anyone who can volunteer to aid in this endeavour,Linked Conservation Data Update,Question of how to assure alignment between the two groups,"No official proposal yet, however, there are probably two issues to discuss:","How do we present different models e.g.: in linked art there is one way to describe dimensions. In LCD there will be a more elaborate way… when someone is approaching the api, how do we direct the request to the correct model? Perhaps technically trivial question (or not) but needs to be answered","What to do when one model updates, how do we organize dependency on the other model? We are talking about LCD but there would be other projects as well",Need an intercommunity model for managing the updates… also the question of linked pasts is another example,Question one is easier to try to tackle first,Should we invite someone from related community to describe their work in the call one in three meetings or so?,Thanasis: I was thinking that this should probably be more of a mechanical problem.  Is this realistic? This can be something to discuss in LCD meeting.,Kevin: do we separate between models and apis? Clean part of the separation of what is expected from the resource. There could be a clean separation when you identify the principle of when there would be a more specialized model/partition from the main data,Having a clear view on the conceptual model is ‘relatively’ easy. But the transition to implementation in an api is about agreeing principles of practice.,Dimensions example: should attribute assignment of measurement should be its own api endpoint or should it just be added into the object representation as it is currently in the documentation,How to know from which endpoint you get the more information? E.g. between a Linked Art dimension pattern which just has a little bit of dimension data and the LCD dimension point which would have a rich amount of information. ,Need  to see it by use cases,"Thanasis: in the long term, if other projects come on board, what level of engagement would one expect with linked art before such a discussion/relation can happen","Rob: if they want to engage, then some in the community that wants to interact should have read the linked art’s documentation","Further on down the road, when linked art documentation is more mature, can help people along more…",Richard: Linked Place framework… the work is fairly independent. Richard follows linked art to see where compatibility may come into place. The use of CRM is what is common between the projects… ,"Joe Padfield: there’s money to hire in SSHOC, to create heritage science fair data sets… they will be created with CIDOC CRM. Would be of interest to see how this overlaps with Linked.art (https://www.sshopencloud.eu/)",How does one build a test model. It would be useful to have examples of how you build your own dataset using linked art,Richard Light: find correlation with Art UK project. Looks to make a mechanism for ingestion of data in the UK. Currently planning to make use of the LIDO framework. Would be interesting exercise to match this up to / with that effort.,Emmanuelle: haven’t heard of this work. There is movement ahead on the LIDO project under a new grant. Could be useful to make sure to march in the same direction.,Joe: AHRC Discovery projects… lots of funding here.  (https://ahrc.ukri.org/research/fundedthemesandprogrammes/tanc-opening-uk-heritage-to-the-world/),"Antoine: Workshop on art research and linked data, specifically about art market research… Antoine introduced linked.art to the discussion. Good discussions. Waiting for notes from that workshop. Presently however there is some struggle to put together the notes post covid. ","Relevant Outcomes: interested in organizing shared workshops/webinar (in relation with Keven's project, among others), have linked art data model checked against the requirement of the workshop participants. They are also creating material for explaining linked open data for researchers/beginners. ",Issue 219: Representative objects,Have representative objects for an artist or style or place,Joe: could also extend this thought to representative object of spaces,Rob proposal: we should have a type to link between the two objects. Can use the pattern of the relationship modelling already in linked art. ,Thanasis: there is no substantial relationship between the two objects. This is a type of categorization relevant to a context.,Joe: do you care about context? The thing is exemplary relevant to some context.,"George: Could use attribute assignment. Seems like a common practice so we should be able to capture it. If you have a relationship and add a property on top, people will use that for everything. Context is very interesting, such as for an exhibition.  Going through an Attribute Assignment lets you contextualize using existing machinery in the model. Basic structure would be to use assigned / assigned_to, with AA node in the middle. Still wouldn't have a property for X being exemplary for Y -- this can be the type, exemplary-ness.  Then have actors and time and so on.",Joe: if we have the notion of assigning a set of things to the object as being exemplary… then should we consider order?,Rob: we try to avoid rdf:list. In json you can rely on the order which is not great but functional.,Also consider this issue in the CRM SIG: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-407-ordinal-property-for-e55-type,The question or order actually lurks in the future. ,Joe: use case… institutions top 100 objects… national gallery has done this many times. This would need context.  ,Kevin: What is relation between highlights and exhibitions? Is there an overlap there?,Should back to the relation of this to exhibitions in another context,Concerns/Decision: rob will document the attribute assignment pattern and see if it works and bring it back to the group. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I.e. include a summary of previous work on the issue and proceed discussing questions on it following from that. Theoretically one issue will feed to another, i.e. make a chain of issues (not sure I am capturing this correctly).","Agreed: Agreeing processes to allow issues or discussions that are raised during the summary are then added to the list for future meetings - makes it easier to end new discussions and stick to a planned agenda, while still letting people's ideas be discussed overall.","RS: Power of the group is in shared skills. Got to come up with a method to make setting the agenda more transparent. Commenting on issues is an indication of people being interested in them. This could be a way to set the agenda, i.e. start with issues with comments and if none is commented then move on to other. Interaction with the issue in the form of “thumbs-up” clicks is enough.",Agreed: To prioritise the commented issues for the agenda.,RS: Good idea for issue raiser to chair the part of the meeting that discusses the issue.,AV: Same practice in CRM-SIG and it works,JP: Also useful to ensure that the raiser has understood the resolution. Also an issue assignment method would be useful.,"RS: People should have access to “assign” tools if they have a GitHub account. If they are not included in the LA repo, then Rob can add them.",Agreed: That the issue raiser can chair the bit of the meeting related to the issue.,RS: The questionnaire is useful to ensure that everyone gets the chance to contribute. ,JP: Consider a separate call only on modelling with worked examples to share experience with other people. This is to address the concerns about lack of time given that the regular meetings are only an hour. A bit of modelling surgery setup,"Edward: A tag/label may be useful for an issue, so that an issue itself can be about a specific example of modeling a set of data.",Agreed: new tag on GitHub “mapping” for issues about specific datasets,"	I have mentioned this before, but I have been working on a system to visualise mapping examples: https://jpadfield.github.io/cidoc-crm.examples/ In the example it is cidoc stuff but it could be used - simple text automatically converted into interactive web models. (JP) Might even just be nice to share agreed example models, if not for discussion.","Kevin: London we put an open call out for people attending the workshop, beyond the people on the calls, to bring their favorite example and a difficult one.  Then this group helped in breakout groups to try and see how linked art fitted modeling the data. Worked well, but a step away from more validation task of working with real data from systems. The timely point of the AHRC grant will have a call for the wider community to suggest use cases with the aim to work up to detailed exemplars. One question is how to continue that in lockdown, as original plan was for a face to face. Not sure we can directly bring them together but thinking how to do it would be useful. Different to brainstorming around a table.","Thanasis: Asked consortium to submit examples of documentation. We curated them in advance to make sure they were useful examples. Purpose was also didactic for the participants. Divided into groups according to interests and people with more experience with CRM would explain the mapping. Some people were even convinced of the process :)  For LCD we consider changes too, haven’t worked out how to do it. Kristen has suggested a format of online seminars / tutorials where people bring their data and we spend an hour looking at the data online. But haven’t formalized that yet.  We can report back when there’s more discussions.","George: Great if those were recorded, especially if they solve a problem. Towards a wider issue putting something together in a PhD program in Cyprus to pick up CRM. Informal dial-in radio show for semantics. Dear abby… :D [/rs]",GB: Having visual and audio with real data and being able to follow is much more useful.,RS: Would this need to be a separate call or replace current regular calls? Possibly be a separate call as the membership may be different. At the moment two calls are not enough to cover all activity.,Kevin:  Mapping discussion where Richard  (e.g.) has data and how to map.  And then the more engaging activity to get others from outside of the group.  E.g. curation of exemplars. Two different cases (or steps to get stuck in),RS: We could usgmae the same process for the discussion but separate workflow to enter the discussion. Individual members may discuss with internal people who wish to discuss modelling and bring them in to the more topical mapping call.,KP: People in the group can discuss and deliver mappings advice to external anyway.,KW: Consider how we could keep track of specific examples to refer to in the future.,RS: Showing example of the photoarchive on the linked.art website as an example of a sample record.,JP: The specific example may be a little scary for people. Joe’s example showing visualization of triples to be shown with a direct HTML links. There is also a way to include documentation on these model-nodes. Joe built is for a specific example but we can replace the underlying data with different examples.,RS: Try to find time and example to do a more practical and model oriented call.,"Agreed: Richard to bring data for example, Edward,  Karina to flesh out use cases.

Three/four months may be more realistic.","Thanasis: for the Linked Conservation Data post, interviewing has completed and one or two hires should be announced soon.",Model issues,Issue 237 (see also 107),"Rob: proposal pending since September would be to use a simple class for relationships with some from/to attributes. However, Attribute Assignment may be a nicer way of doing this. Both patterns are very, very similar; so if we could use generic AAs then we wouldn’t have to make a relationship class. Meaning one less thing to maintain.","In relation to the model example for student-teacher-school. Attribute Assignement, used here:",```turtle,<teacher> assigned_to_by AttribAssignment,AttribAssignment assigns <student> ;,  P177_assigned_property_type <teacher-of> .,```,George: doing something like the AA pattern in order to express arbitrary things (x is related to y) as random relationship... this seems like a better pattern. But I wouldn’t make it recommended. Plus one to current suggestion.,"Joe: would you want to twin this with a vocabulary of relationships? For Linked.Art, do we centralise an agreed list of types?","Antoine: there’s always a need to find a pertinent vocabulary, which is a wider problem than the specific implementation being discussed.",Rob: how to express sufficient usability balanced with sufficient interoperability? The vocabulary and the pattern are inextricably linked.,"Thanasis: not particularly happy with the structure. The Attribute Assignment is often used to indicate that somebody has an opinion about something. In a way, I do not see the student as an attribute that the teacher receives. In some cases we may want to express this, but in others it exists already - in which case expressing an AA doesn’t make sense.",Rob: because AA is typically expressing properties not relationships?,"Thanasis: for example, if somebody is a sibling of someone else… ontologically they are [related] and not properties.",George: yes; which is why if you have any other option then don’t do this. One of the reasons we didn’t want to handle social relations is to avoid biting off more than we can chew in terms of the ontology.,Thanasis: is the problem that the CRM soc haven’t formalised the relationship properties? It’s a matter of time before Linked Art accepts their resolution. We don’t want to make a decision here beforehand.,"Joe: as an alternative, one of the ways this could be done is make the person a member of a group. Then define the relationships in the definition of the group. Also not perfect.",Rob: Getty has done this too. It works OK for people and roles. E.g. the PM of New Zealand is a Group which only ever has one member. But issues arise when we’re not talking about a person or set of people. And directionality is tricky too. Which essentially just moves the problem. Having something consistent with representative objects would be good as it would be consistent. So we want a relatively-straightforward-and-not-wrong way to express this.,Rob: ,```turtle,Conceptual Object assigned_to_by AttribAssign,Assign assigns Type ( number ),```,Does this seem semantically incorrect? Compare this purely mathematical example to the specific sibling example?,George: if you knew the direct relationship then you would use an existing component of the ontology. This has to support cases where it’s not known.,Thanasis: how soon does this need to be implemented? Would it be better to sort this is CRM SOC beforehand?,Joe: you could have relationships between two E1s. That’s the level of the generic problem.,Thanasis: I don’t think so; I think it’s within the bounds of social interaction.,George: hasn’t the problem opened up more broadly? Student-teacher is just an example. But also… the moon is related to the sun… through galaxy… things.,Rob: where we have these statements we want to use them.,Joe: any use of this data must have strict processing rules so that properties aren’t creeping into inferences for other relations.,"Thanasis: if we want to express a relationship between any two things, how valuable is allowing searching on it? Maybe we do not support such a thing with tooling.","Rob: yes, search could become terribly complicated or unreliable.","Joe: this type of relationship is important to hold on to, but how should it be re-used. There’s a difference between data being held in limbo pending being modelled and it remaining so for use.","Rob: regardless of all the other problems, the September proposal seems worse than Attribute Assignment. However AA has exactly the same set of problems with the exception that it will already be understood by CRM community members. Therefore, let’s work with SOC to explore the bonds issue. Because if there is a better pattern coming from bonds it would be better to avoid having two patterns.",Ryan: bye,"Rob: would prefer, however, to have something written down for this pending resolution at the end of the calendar year. This at least improves the situation.","Thanasis: it might be unclear, in this model, what is assigned to what. How do you decide which side the thing goes? Do we really have such a burning need for this? In terms of peoples’ real data do we need this in v1?","Rob: good question. We could be silent on it. Probably every CMS has examples of HMOs with related_object, which is similar. Both related- and representative-objects seem pretty ubiquitous. So would prefer to have something in v1, yes.",Thanasis: OK,Antoine: agree. It matches better the DCAT qualified relationship pattern. Still a bit luke warm about Attribute Assignment as it may encourage people to put provenance data here. But if that provenance is optional it's fine!,"Joe: we need several worked examples to ensure that the directionality works. You may always require pairs of AAs, because both things have a relationship. This is messy but captures the duality.",Antoine: the other pattern supported from and to.,Issue 219,(Dimensions of arrangement),Rob: Getty CMS has dimension with types which simply describe those dimensions at the time that the dimensions were taken. State does complicate things significantly in that it is an ongoing thing in an ontology that is configured around changes in state.,"Rob: is there something we want to try to work on, or defer? Do we want to tackle this?","Joe: is this a class question or a type question? Class would complicate the ontology, with an infinite number of instances of the state of the object. Making vocabulary controlled hierarchies of types is maybe a simple solution.",Object has dimension. Dimension has type width. Width has type width with lid open.,It’s a bunch of types either way you do it! At scale it might be a lot simpler to string together a lot of different dimensions than model all the events which invoke state changes in the object.,Rob: what about a polyhierarchy of the terminology: dimension terms and state terms?,"George: use technique and procedure and say that measuring in one state or another is not a function of the object. Rather that we used to open-map style of measuring. Object went through a measurement event. We would need a sensible vocabulary to describe these measuring procedures. There are real discussions about this, so presumably we can name and describe these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most meetings/conferences being cancelled. For now next face-to-face meeting in June is not far away for planning. Other conferences in June (IIIF) have not cancelled, but may delay if IIIF or others begin to cancel. No absolute reason to have it in June, good timing and splits the year, so we could delay. Recommendation to wait on travel until we know more so do not book. Fall back strategy is to delay until September (July/August not good). Would want it in the first half of September if possible. Kevin, Richard, Rob, Saskia discussing what to do and how to make the best of it.","Thanasis: Linked Conservation does not have many events this year, do have event in May in UK. May have to be cancelled. UK govt is relaxed, but does not mean people will not refuse to travel. General advice from university is to postpone until Autumn. May end up in September with many other postponed events and dates will be difficult.",Jamie: Organizing workshop in Florida in October for html hypertext.,	Canadian govt not panicking. ,Thanasis: AHRC does allow for extensions in extraordinary events. This may be the case for other institutions as well.,"Rob: Especially for collaborative projects like Linked Art. For next call for funding, would open in September possibly for February? Organizing a new project may be deprioritzed because virus, so may be delay.",Thanasis: AHRC organized two (at least) conferences to discuss next round of funding (April and possibly May) if these cancelled they will have less to work with so another reason for delays.,API issues first,#166 Blank Nodes,Rob: Answer from Philadelphia was could use blank node whenever needed except when API requires it to be a top level resource in JSON-LD. ,Thanasis: Apart from dereferencing any other problems?,"Rob: Eg if a third party wanted to annotate the blank node rather than system as a whole. Could annotate the person, but could not annotate the name specifically. That is clumsy because we do have the machinery to do this. ",Thanasis: Not encouraging. Just saying if there is not a URI then do not worry.,Rob: But if one can then one should use the URI.,Dave: Annotation could record the use of the API and not identifier? Similar to image identifying. Image of an object on a website. Gives a reference to an image without an ID (concept not an ID). But there are instances of creation of content where one has to refer to a particular image in time. Are there parallels?,"Rob: In Web Annotation Model there are cases. The source is a diskimage and selects a byte range. In Xpath Selects a span. No well known standard in graphs. JSON path could work for representation. Does rely on annotation specific machinery, but does solve for this specific use case.",Dave: If modelled everything as annotations then could solve.,"Rob: To repeat, may use blank nodes but should use URI’s. Must use URI’s if it is dereferenced according to API. ","Dave: Clarify when one should make up a URI? Eg if there is a practice for creating a URI then one should create it, but do not just make one up out of thin air.",Jamie: Why does one want to use a blank node?,Rob: If there is not a stable ID in content management system. Then it means artificially creating one that is reproducible across changing content management systems. Question from Ethan arose out of not wanting to store all the created URI’s. ,Thanasis: In CRM to get from one entity to another may have to jump through a number of extra entities. So one would have create extra nodes.,Rob: Guidance for this - should it be an implementation note? ,Dave: Error on the side of implementation note.,#202 Allow language based content negotiation.,Rob: French/English example. Only wanting French but take English if no French. ,"Rob: Should not prevent, but no reason to call it out. Antoine says could note the possibility not do not recommend a best practice.","Dave: Concern about the size of response? A lot of not typically used languages may discard the results. May get header sent without user realizing it, need to be cognizant if wants all languages. Can there be a wildcard on except language?",Rob: Implicit “everything else” default.,"Dave: THis may exclude all except one example (ie only US-English in a US search, would exclude other languages that the user may have wanted).",Bree: Different resources in countries with two or more languages and parts of the population only speak one (Finland example). Gives different results based.,Rob: Problematic when one does not return results in another language. Another problem if browser cannot swap languages. ,Jamie: Not done in server. Example where a user does not get anything should not be the case.,"Rob: Troublesome case is when one asks for something and it is not available, does one get nothing or something else?","Dave: Concern about not saying “do not do this” is one would miss out on substantial portion of graph because of excluding languages. However, could be a useful API feature. Could be misleading if one does not realize this at the beginning of implementation.",Rob: In the absence of select language header then it should return all data it has access to.,Dave: Could be confusing. Need to say in spec “ignore language header”. Casual user will only see language set in browser. Is that a problem?,Rob: Does seem like a problem. It is data to be rendered. Normal user actively browsing JSON-LD is low. Downside is size. Ignore except language would return same data in multiple languages. ,Dave: May have to create another standard in order to reduce number of languages in the response. URL would be different and explicitly filtering on another language in this casae so it is obvious in this case. And not the canonical URI.,Rob: If “except language” is absent (probably the default case) then return all languages and allow client to sort it out. If present then return based on preferences.,So can ask for everything or if one is aware,#205 API versioning approach,"Rob: Could use same versioning approach as IIIF.  Major, Minor, Patch system.",Dave: That is not efficient. Kiosk scenario from github. Do not want to pay vendor to revise kiosk in every version of Linked Art.,Rob: Requirement for media type. ,Dave: Most would be programmatic so could use this header. Caveat is would have to get into habit of setting headers.,Rob: Version 3 of IIIF example. Could specify version from the same URI and would return correct version. ,Use semantic versioning and version based content negotiation to manage cross version software incorporation.,Adjourn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exhibition modeling was tackled on the second day (major topic of this f2f meeting), based on many use cases from MoMA. Activity of putting on the exhibition, concept of the exhibition (important bc activities dont have subjects), planning documents (checklists…).

What if the person looking at the language of the label does not speak that language? They would still need to dereference the URI.,The question is do we want to have multiple labels available? Would anyone use this functionality? Rob thinks it might be overkill and that we should have a rule about not having multiple labels. Dave B agrees. Sami: no use case at Newfields for multiple labels.,“_label” with the underscore is intended to convey that it is not data. ,"Named but unidentified actorshttps://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/246 ",How to document how to describe un-identified actors.,Use case: we know that someone called Yan van de velde has created many items but there are 3 creators with the same name. Option 1: Create an unidentified Yan van de velde which returns many undifferentiated results so unsatisfying. Option 2: create a group that represents a set of people but that’s a bit strange from ontology pov bc we could have a group with 1 person. ,Suggestion: Create an unidentified group of describable people.,"Use case: want to know all works made in the 16th century.

Which suggests that some kind of content negotiation should take place here. Are web standards / technologies sufficiently developed that we can offer this? This would be a useful discussion.",Levels of implementation,Can we define the rules for minimum (or greater) implementation(s) to be considered valid?,Upcoming topics:,Date,Model,API,Other,January 29th,Face-to-Face 3,February 12th,Consider LDP,February 26th ,March ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is there a preference for what this should be?,"Daniel has created a core definitions file which can be referenced: is there anything like this in TTL, i.e. the ability to use “$ref” (references) to reference fragments of other documents, thus simplifying the process of creating these validation documents (JSON Schema, maybe TTL), and their longer-term maintenance? This is a feature of SHACL -- you can create shapes which can function in this way, they are reusable--allows constraints to be nested. ",Daniel: JSON ref can create those references--might need a list of resources for this sort of thing,Next steps: Ping on Slack when Dave has something to present,Transclusions in the API - officially allow or not? Some way to signal?,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/411  ,Should we allow some notion of displacement/transclusion of data into other parts of the model? --example is translation/multi-language applied to a work,Reference one end point to another there should be a record,Do we use the URI to point to? Or is it blank nodes--only include ID if you want to follow it to the record?,Set the object is the member of--pointing to set and a minimized portion of it in the parent document--maybe as an attribute,If you shouldn’t follow the URI you shouldn’t include it--should be dereferencable,"Kevin: In terms of consistent behaviour +1 to Rob. That's distinct from whether a client can work out from a URI whether that URI will defererence (no, a client can't know for sure until it tries)--balance between the client trying and failing vs it being consistent",Rob’s examples below--which one do we want to use? 1. Embedded or 2. Separate document,"Dave: I think this is a pure API feature and we should leave the default partitioning alone for the ""static document"" case.--quite a few use cases considered separately--if you want transclusion you should request through an API feature as opposed to behavior of static document generation.",If we split these into documents within the system (creates lots of them)--then we need filter them out when looking for texts and digital things (2nd pattern you’ll find way too many objects because each real object has 3 digital objects) 1st pattern implicit blank node identifier doesn’t create this multiplicity,Edward: if all the LinguisticObjects are split up then you have the problem that a client needs to parse them all to work out which are websites,Dave: I think that's an API feature - requesting the linguistic objects for an art object that also happen to be web sites. ,I guess we should ask what the limit of use cases is for the statically generated JSON context where there's not an API implementation available.,Daniel: If it’s only going to used once embed if it’s more than once separate document,Labels we don’t use for anything....(forgot the rest...sorry)--for reference,Kevin: How could a client signal a wish for inline/transclusion? And/or could we default to inline/transclusion but be able to fallback to separate documents if there were hypermedia provided to do so? Any deployment would need to choose one or t'other.,"Dave: Without an API implementation available, I don't think they can signal any wishes.  They would just have a static set of JSON documents to navigate.","Proposal: allow displacement (blank nodes) subject of <textual works>, <textual works> digitally carried, <textual works> digitally shown: , if we really have to we can embed",If this is permitted in JSON schema and SHACL shapes we should allow it to work at a document level rather than at the graph level,Does this complicate client implementations,Should we say how they should do it rather than having separate documents,"Kevin: URIs are overloaded in web architecture?... surely not ;-)  (i.e. yes). URI management is a valid, though slightly separate concern I think. And Rob when you say allowed do you mean must? Yes",Ex. Photo album--pictures within pictures and part of a whole.,Does this add a level of complexity when collections are cataloged in a variety of ways?,Do you need to have an ID if it’s embedded in a parent? ,"Solve--(missing the first part of Rob’s statement...) there is no ID must have a type and carried by and language, ",Blank nodes do create some problems,Edward: We are not going to be able to easily mint IDs for LinguisticObjects which are carried by homepages. Much prefer to displace,"Kevin: The API spec must ensure clients can be robust when following their nose. Relatedly, but separately, there could be helpful guidance for internal logic which can help service implementations, which I think would assuage concerns about these variations on the standard pattern.

Or you may have a group of 17th Century Italian paintings and again you may want to reference an exemplar that you can highlight for illustrative purposes. Another use case is an archive of letters, where there hasn’t been the time to catalogue or digitize them all, but you could reference a concrete example that has been catalogued and digitized, and that exemplar (or a small group of exemplars from that set) would be representative of the information that the remainder of the things in the Set carry.","Question: Is this property something that the wider group could see as being useful, or is perhaps more limited in its usefulness, and perhaps best suited to say archives, and would another modelling pattern be better suited?","Overall responses: Considered useful for logical groupings, conceptual things. Archives are still used / available in museums. Also shards of vases (etc) -- we know they belong together, but we don’t catalog all of the shards individually. Could point to the catalog entry for the described ones. Archaeo digs for instance.","Point raised asking if the idea of aboutness could be used to model this instead or as well as? Noted that this is needed more at the leaf-node level. Say we have boxes and boxes of things, but we just haven’t had opportunity to catalogue everything in the boxes, but some of the things are catalogued and could be used as representative exemplars and could help someone searching (or a system) to find the box that they came from, and thus discover the other things in that box too.","You don’t want to create specific types to group things, but by having this exemplar mechanism, there is more flexibility.","How complete would the cataloguing of the exemplar need to be for it to be useful? If the exemplar is a reasonable stand-in for the others in the group, then it could be useful. It is not clear if this mechanism will help on a logical level, but it could be useful for users.","Issue 427 (Entity Exemplar Templates) was separated out from this, and offers a looser mechanism, that can just define some of the most important properties of the items in a group. The Entity Exemplar Templates (Issue 427) mechanism effectively represents items conceptually in a broad way – but when you have a representative example of a collection – such as the Torosaurus skull from the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History (YPM VP.001830) that is considered the holotype, the members_exemplified_by property would be better suited to reference it.","If you would be able to look at the exemplar, it should be as representative as possible of the other items in the set or the other items that would be included in the set if they had also been catalogued and digitized.","How would these exemplars be used by data consumers? If a user was using a discovery environment/tool, you could index the exemplar against the Set, so when you are searching, the whole Set could be surfaced by search terms matching against the exemplar, with the user experience, where necessary, clarifying that all the surfaced things in the Set matched due to the properties catalogued in the exemplar and/or as well as possibly because some of terms matched against the individual catalogued things in the Set (depending on how the search query was written). The user interface could then allow access to all of the records included in the Set for further review. This could help make records discoverable that otherwise would not be easily found due to the limited amount of cataloguing information some records may have in a collection, such as the vase fragment case, where perhaps only a small number of the total fragments have been catalogued to any meaningful depth; the remaining records may only be very minimal, with just a title, accession number, and dimensions, for instance, compared to the exemplar records in the group, which would be selected due to their deeper level of cataloguing.","The intention of this mechanism is to group identified sets, such as all of the paintings in the paintings department, or all of the known fragmentary shards that constitute a given vase.","For things that are currently part of the set, the thing would be a member_of the Set; but being able to say what other things are like the things currently in the Set, is where having a representative example is helpful.","It was asked, in the scope note of a Linked.art Set, is a Set considered closed or open? In the overall context of Linked Data, entities are generally considered open, and other users could effectively assert that something else was a member of another’s Set. However, the practicality or appropriateness of doing so, doesn’t always make this possible or likely, so ontologically the defined sets would act as though they were closed sets.","Someone has said that this is the exemplar for this set, even if it is not the most representative thing in this set, and computation of the properties may reveal another thing that is more exemplary, however the importance is that this item has been called out by someone as the exemplar. The exemplar may not have been chosen because it is the most representative property-wise of the entire set, but may be chosen because it is the most recognized, and most easily brings to mind the properties of things in the set, than a more obscure, but mathematically more correct exemplar would.","Would we need to be able to reference more than one exemplar for a Set? Perhaps a small number of exemplars would better represent the group than any single example could. Also if there were differences in the property values between the exemplars, that could reveal more about the scope of the things in the Set than a single exemplar likely could. The members_exemplified_by property is defined with  multiplicity enabled, so would be able to reference more than one thing.",https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/427 – Entity Exemplar vs Templates,"How in a machine-accessible way do we say, for example, that this Set contains items that are made of terracotta, or that this box contains letters written by Trimble?","Should we create computed (conceptual) entities which do not necessarily have or do not describe any individual thing in reality, but where knowing the properties that apply universally to the items in the Set would be helpful?","The template mechanism is much closer to the “shapes approach”, i.e. that the members of this given Set meet this templated definition, i.e. the properties of the templated (non-existent) thing. You would only define properties in the template that represented all of the items in the Set, such as that all the items in the Set are made of terracotta.",It seems that there are more potential issues with the templating mechanism; how would it be clearly conveyed that something was just conceptual (a template) rather than a representation of something real? This would need to be clearly defined and conveyed. Could a new class or property just be used to help convey this.,"Scoped contexts? This mechanism could help make the modelling cleaner, so it would be consistent in the raw JSON-LD with the classes and properties used to model real things, but when translated to RDF, a HumanMadeObject for example, could be translated to for example HumanMadeObjectTemplate by virtue of being modelled under the exemplified_by property of Type. The usage of scoped contexts could be advantageous here. Good documentation and potentially a required property such as classified_as (aat:computed) “Computed Entity” would call out these things as not be representations of real physical things for the purposes of filtering and for those just consuming the raw JSON, rather than accessing the data as RDF via a graph store.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Rob’s example code is currently based on obtaining WikiData’s internal JSON document, and extracts the properties that it can, that it has been coded to work with, and then reformats the obtained data into a Linked.Art modelled resource; the code is not based on a graph nor does it currently use SPARQL; however, it can be used offline just reading in any downloaded WikiData JSON documents of the supported types. Rob is hoping to develop a wrapper for some of the other authorities in addition to this current WikiData prototype, such that we can then merge/link the records together from the different authorities for the same entity to build up a broader/more complete view of the entity, and make that data available according the Linked.Art model/schema, which will help increase the interoperability of these useful authority datasets. Sharing of code for the prototype to follow.",Equivalence Property for Linked.Art:,"When we have multiple external authorities and we do not have a way to pick just one, Rob noted that it would be useful to have an equivalent property so that you can reference as many of them as you need to and state that they have equivalence – with the assertion of the equivalence being made by the publisher of the data. The current set of properties available for models are defined in the Linked.Art documentation here: https://linked.art/api/1.0/shared/type/ – while we have properties such as broader to note that something is the broader concept of something, there is currently a gap in the Linked.Art model with regards to stating equivalence, as such Rob is proposing the addition of the new property to help close this gap. Another question came up to decide if the new equivalent term should be available in the Properties of Types or if it should be in the Extended Properties set; if it is available in the top-level Properties of Types, the equivalent property could be used for many different use-cases; more than would be possible if the property was only made available within the Extended Properties set. One of the main benefits of the equivalent property is being able to state the equivalence between Types, such as between the Getty Vocabularies term for “Painting” and Yale’s equivalent term; this helps extend and simplify the interoperability of the data. There is also the potential need to include a back-reference. If the equivalent property is used, it would need to used consistently across the modelling so that an aggregator for instance, would not need to process all of to find the one or limited number of instances of the equivalence property to be able to follow the concept, even though using the equivalence property would be making a global-assertion, that globalness is still reliant on coming across and parsing the document or documents that contain that global-assertion. If the property is used consistently across all relevant documents, then a consumer of the data only needs to process the document or documents they are interested in to be able to follow the equivalence links.","Also discussed was could the mapping of equivalence be mapped elsewhere, such that the equivalent properties could potentially be included in one place and then used as a lookup table? However, if this was supported, it would usually require clients to pull in this lookup table each time to parse a document, although that document itself may only reference a very small percentage of the items mapped in the lookup table; this contrasts with the additional verbosity/repetition of using the equivalent property within individual documents.",Hypertext Application Language (HAL) and Linked.Art:,"David Beaudet shared more about HAL – Hypertext Application Language – a specification for communication information about resources that are at or below or even above an endpoint. It supports patterns that could be templated, so that you could have an entity that gets filled in for an API response, or the data could be embedded in the response; there is support for pagination and traversal of links with familiar properties such as next, prev, etc. It is not a very complicated specification which is appealing, and it seems to dovetail nicely with the existing Linked.Art specification. There are a few properties that we would have to be familiar with so as not to get confused, such as it has a “type” property, but overall there aren’t any incompatibilities, and it could help with making Linked.Art APIs discoverable/consumable in a machine-readable way. It was noted that it seems to work smoothly and follow standards, and could optionally be used to extend the self-documentation of records and reference other endpoints or services that could be followed which integrate with the LOD data, such as an identity resolution service.","By being able to leverage the HAL specification, this information could be included in LOD documents in a standards-compliant way using an existing standard, and allows metadata about data consumption and any available related data services to sit alongside the data itself. It does not prescribe any required services that an institution would need to adopt or provide in order to be compliant, allowing flexibility in adoption. Its primary benefit seems to be the ability to include the documentation about such services and the use of an API to be included/provided in place along with the LOD, rather than hoping that data consumers independently happen upon any separate documentation resources, which would otherwise be needed to get the most benefit from some datasets.",More notes about this topic are available in Linked.Art Issue #412 – https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/412.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most people will be able to use something like this.,Dave: if we can get .csv generating users to engage then we will be able to go far relatively quickly.,Edward: https://github.com/edwardanderson/linked-art-csv ,Tanya: would such a tool include reconciliation functionality?,Dave: extremely useful but not essential. Layered approach?,Dave: MARC’s strength in performing genuine interoperability should be an inspiration.,"Daniel: let’s be inspired by the IIIF community: shared tooling, linking dataset, helping, inspiring. What museum doesn’t want to help share and educate? Obvious use-case is that no institution has all of an artist’s output. Something equivalent to a IIIF implementation level system would be very helpful; being able to show people how participating isn’t so difficult and that significant results can be made quickly.",Rob: IIIF benefitted from quick and dirty shims to prove utility. See ContentDM / OCLC.,Daniel: ideally Linked Art could be integrated to CMSes. Maybe we could attempt something similar to the IIIF letter to DAM vendors encouraging implementations.,"Richard: museums are locked into the vendors and even with enthusiasm, they don’t have the agency to make the change. Although the are the audience they are not the agents.","Daniel: perhaps we could make, say, a plug-in for TMS?

What we’re really talking about is a group where all the participants share a set of features: e.g. birth, or active, or died, etc.","The proposed property, then, is to exemplify the group.","Could be a set of objects sharing a language, or an institution, etc.",However. There is potential for range conflict where a set of objects is exemplified by a text which has language x. But language is not allowed to be applied to HMOs.,There is an existing CRM property for this. It’s for the members of the set and not the `type`.,Was there a second use-case? It doesn’t make sense to mint identifiers for people we know next to nothing about.,"John: thinking about this from the researcher side, and how inclusive the group is, and how findable. Some institutions have, e.g., first half of C14th, or first quarter of that century. Do these groups block each other?",Rob: no… members can belong to multiple groups.,"John: really encouraging, great.","Antoine: Group is problematic here when there is only a single member, because the member is a Person.","Rob: when we say that an artwork was produced by a workshop, we don’t mean that all the members of the group produced it, rather that (at least) one member of the group made it. Having groups with only a single member is still OK.","Antoine: yes, but the problem still is that the artwork was made by a Group… but it was made by a Person who belongs to a Group.",Rob: but while we don’t know who the person was…,"Rob: the only scope where all members of a group are involved is in ownership. Whereas, for example, if a Group prints a work, not all members of the group participated. The attribution of this still belongs to the Group.",Antoine: but there are cases where the author of a work is a Group. Not being able to distinguish between all members participating and an unknown number of them participating feels dangerous.,Antoine: what about collectives of artists who have refused individual attribution?,"Edward: so… we should credit John, Paul, Ringo and George individually for creating a song and not the Beatles?","Rob: the relationship between the activity and the group needs to be clear about the sort of participation: carried out by at least one member of, or… some qualifier.",Jonathan: the distinction in libraries is that there’s a difference between an ethnic group (say) and a corporate body. This differentiates intentionally formed groups from classifying groups.,Antoine: maybe indeed the process of incorporation could be quite similar to what happens to when a group decides to form. Are the Beatles considered to be a corporate body?,"Jonathan: I think they are, yes.","Rob: [refers to CIDOC-CRM spec]. In terms of definition it feels like the CRM definition of Group is on solid ground. Whether we agree with this is another question. If the Greeks are a Group, then 3rd century BC Greeks who created amphorae are a sub-group of it.","Antoine: the foundation is solid. But, for example, one amphora is not created by the Greeks.",Rob: but the Beatles did make a song.,"Jonathan: lots of objects, historically, have been described as being created by the Navajo. May be undesirably general but still useful.","Rob: how do we distinguish, then, between these two types of groups?","Antoine: if it’s [Group] a subclass of Actor, then it shouldn’t be forbidden for participating. An Activity can be carried out by individuals or groups, so we’re in a position to reflect this.",Rob: we cannot be clear about which (or all) members of a Group participated in the event.,Edward: so we could exemplify a group by a sort of blank node Person? And link to the (an?) individual directly.,"Antoine: the use-case for Group exemplification is good, but there is a family of quite different use-cases here.",Rob: some cases are a template where the exemplification should be applied to all members; others where it’s fuzzy and not all the criteria will apply to all the members.,Edward: what about using a really complex AttributeAssignment to describe which characteristics definitely belong to the Group?,Rob: it would indeed be really complex and the aim here is to find something much simpler.,"Antoine: separating these use-cases might clarify which are more urgent, allowing us to find the simple pattern.",Edward: can PC14 be used like roles?,Rob: maybe. Would want to seek further guidance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Link above. Please send to anyone who would interested. First six months on Linked Art and checks on real world data. Last 18 months will be more open but will take the Linked Art knowledge into those projects.,Rob: LINCS conference this week. Erin gave talk. ,Erin: Making decision on ontology. With Cidoc CRM. Later today will be people using the CRM for first time. Video will be available next week. Registration is still open. ,https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/lincs-conference-2021-tickets-148939757825,Would be happy to give a recap of that talk on a future Linked Art call.,Rob: for today take a higher level look at cross institutional data and how it could benefit from Linked Art. ,"Sarah: Working on name authority and identity right now. Desire for artist demographic data is ballooning. Push now to acquire elements through questionnaires. Interested in a wiki based installation as a collaborative repository instead of TMS. Maybe something like ORCID. Artists are able to manage their identity, does not affect non living artists. ULAN is a key piece of Linked Art. Getty vocab and LoC are not equipped for volume of contributions, and different information, and not responsive sometimes. Can Linked Art accommodate the increased weight on identifiers that is coming out now. Aware this could result in a lot of locally managed data (what we want to avoid). ",Rob: re survey for living artists to document their identities: The Yale Gallery is involved. Jonathan is indirectly involved. ,"Sarah: Association of Art Museum Curators is umbrella group. MoMA, YUAG, PMA involved. Trying to have best practices to generate a survey for questions such as nationality, disability. This is personal. And fluidity is understood. Updating is built in (not the case for LoC, Getty). Again only applies to living artists or those with active estates. Hard to translate the artists’ language into a controlled value. ",Jonathan: Question of wiki based vs wikidata. ,Sarah: Amount of control. Relying on wikidata may not be accepted by some institutions. Small staffed institutions would be able to contribute. Governance of the wiki based system would be an issue. But worthwhile to explore. Jonathan: excited but maybe another platform?,"Rob: re wiki based, because of what is needed a created database could have the same functionality as wiki based. We would not need all the abilities of wiki based. ","Rob: What is needed for Linked Art? Nationality, names over time, gender over time. To be able to model over time would be useful both for Linked Art and the survey.","Erin: Can share regarding the label, work done for LINCS. ",Rob: Question of relationship (LGBTQ or LGBTQIA). Erin: going to look to Homosaurus which has looked at relationships. And will point to URI not a string. Label would be descriptive content. Structured content may not be the same. ,"Sarah: From library perspective of authorities, gathering minimal/essential data points. Goal is disambiguation but some people want to add all linked data available. ","Rob: Lack of community process around authorities. Some can add to AAT immediately. How to maintain control while the community is encouraged to contribute. American Art Collaborative asked how to small, specialized museums contribute. Getty says they will add it but the institution doing the research do not get the credit for creation and management. Needed for more visitors and sponsors. Is there anything to be done especially on data management and cultural sense to avoid the cultural hegemony that exists on authority management.",Sarah: Possibility of meeting about this or sharing notes. ,Ethics of publishing data on living data,"Emmanuelle: Creation of a subcommittee.  Balance the research needs versus the sensitivity to other elements like gender, sexuality. Risks inherent to tracking people’s identity need to be addressed.",Rob: Anyone else working around living artists and the use/misuse of the data? Example of women artists. We need to know who are the women artists. Nationality is less of an issue. But sexuality or religion could be misused. ,"Jonathan: Framed as not collecting data that is not already out there. Public info. It can be disputed, but not making statement on validity. Not going further than a search of published materials. So not make authority statement.",Erin: Recent publication “Ethical Questions in Name Authority Control” as a reference publication: https://litwinbooks.com/books/ethical-questions-in-name-authority-control/,Sarah: NGA catalogers are reading that together. One decision is not to include gender for LC. ,Erin: Specific chapters on linked data and name authorities. ,Richard: Not collection that now. ,Emmanuelle: Living artists poses a risk of being asked the same questions over and over. ,Rob: If there is an open authority it is being published. Not open means they are being asked over and over. Current approach is if data is in an authority then will publish but do not go beyond that. ,Jonathan: From conversations wiki based allows for some control but allows individual institutions to add data. Balance of the tensions. ,Rob: Can we determine the gaps to see what should go into 1.0? What else can we be doing?,"Sarah: AAMC group getting anonymous surveys, could take themes from those to see how they could map in Linked Art. This is probably the next step. This info may go into TMS. ",If this information ends up somewhere non local what would happen? ,Next step is what are consensus information points that museums are adding?,"#419 - members_exemplified_by for Set, Group",Works in English for example or works in the Getty.,"Better for something like unknown 14th century Italian. Not one person, but a set of unknown people. Can query based on the known information.

They are using LA to describe an entire collection. 10,000’s of objects donated to the university. LA is the core description pattern. New digital site to engage with users. Mapping was none almost exactly correctly. 11am ET not good for Asia. Difficult for Europe, USA, and Asia all to be on a call. ","Possible one call a month for Asian callers? Jonathan: Is there anyone on the West Coast? 8am ET call would be 1pm UK, 10pm Japan. Could try that time once a month?","Kevin / Richard: application to the V&A collaboration doctoral program was taken forward. Joint with Kevin, Dave De Roure (also OeRC), Sarah Ogilvie (computational linguistics), and  V&A supervisor Marion Crick (Head of Collections Management), ","Pull in information from other institutions, b/c of limitations of data at V&A. Want LA to reflect changes in the data. Job share possibility for 2nd supervisory role with Angus Patterson (Senior Curator) and Richard. ",Similar project in Netherlands from Chris: https://www.clue.vu.nl/en/projects/Pressing-Matter/index.aspx,"Kevin: AHRC  and NEH proposal feedback. Have received NEH side, will not receive AHRC (not their policy). First note was lack of polish (timing was part of that). Also stretched across a number of objectives. Need to target the call as what the funder wants. Even smaller requests had more objectives. Public, institutions, and LA need to support the next steps. Hard to have use case to cover all objectives. Studentship could be part of this in the future. ","Thanasis: Feedback from LCD, only reviews from NEH. Similar feedback to LA. One reviewer was negative about value of CRM. Another comment thought Phase III did not have enough new direction. It was similar because Phase II was limited to only one year. ","Kevin: Structural weakness in the call, announced Jan/Feb and then Phase III were asked for in April. NEH Phase III are very hard to get. And those limits not apparent to US reviewers. ","Only Ethan’s was a linked data project. Also few Phase III projects. And no mention of AI from LA or LCD. US presentations had AI, UK presentations may have moved on. Difference in the funding providers.","Kevin: New idea: Horizon Europe. EU’s 7 year research and innovation program. Larger funding pots. Possible LA with a LCD sub-program? Provisional first work program has cluster. “Preserving cultural heritage”. Only EU and affiliated countries. Work programs are pre-determined, must fit to the call. Could be a 7 year wait if we don’t fit. Horizon Europe doesn’t actually exist, due to be signed soon. Could be a rush b/c of that. Timing could be 1 January, 2021. Also the Brexit arrangement. ","Rob: Clarification of UK affiliation with EU and its backdating to 1 January. Kevin will need at least 3 institutions across EU, UK and Switzerland. Affiliate country could likely be the lead. ","Thanasis: LCD has Greece, Italy, France, possibly Spain. Could be discussed. George: Large document and tough competition. ","Chris: Rijksmuseum is looking at the call. Would be interested. Thanasis: Need to see the call to see if European partners (Sapienza, Italy or University in Greece) would be interested. Universities could be considering other consortia. Kevin: Documentation of the call is very complex. Oxford has support system for this. ","Thanasis: Reviewing online LCD workshop. Amount of time was not enough. London workshop was better. Lots of people joined. Interest has not waned over the past years. Another online modelling workshop should have a structure reconsidering. First part was introduction to CRM and collecting some samples. Second day was discussion of CRM profile for conservation (George and Rob were there), thoughts about what elements are most important. ","George: Organization was great, lectures and workshops on both days. Recap of work was helpful. Difficult to do online without people in front and a number of hours to do it.

Same for visual work (embed in physical object).,Do not have to get certain information separately because it can be found when the object is dereferenced. ,"Kevin: Is it in line transclusion? Or displacement? Rob: Displacement is easiest, no need to make files. ","Rob: Maybe undisplace later if needed? Kevin: Uri should exist but question of what to expect to receive it one goes to it directly. Rob: Similar question in IIIF, each property has its own embedding rules. Dave: Might satisfy one use case, but could be others once it is in practice. Should this be a requirement for an access API? Instruct server to merge in response, instead of default response. ","Rob: Return to question of transclusion vs displacement. Kevin: referring to Dave, how often? Dave: one example acquiring the text of linguistic object. ","Rob: Other examples do not separate textual from visual. MARC goes on bib not holdings. TMS example too. Reason why systems have one record. Difference is for photographs, copies of books, makes sense and cannot get rid of this step. Should we require client to dereference it? Maybe just build it and see what traffic and costs are? But if user is waiting while browser is bringing everything, it could take a while to render the page. ",Edward: Is there something on the JSON level to note that needs embedding? Kevin: Still would be a maintenance cost. API is about sensible defaults for partitioning. ,Dave: Querying could address some of this: Edward: Specific endpoint? Rob could save one hop? ,Rob: Any progress on the AHRC programmer? Kevin: Progress but not a date. Spec could be advertised in the next week or two.,Rob: Implementing a redirect implies it knows were to redirect to. May be simpler to have smaller points. [I did not fully understand that- McQ]. ,Rob: Harder to implement the non-transclusion way. Kevin: Seems better to do it this way. But should we care about any fallbacks of any maintenance costs on the backend? Rob: Fallbacks could be in a minor release. Kevin: Cost of consistency checking.

Maybe counterproductive to solely focus on objects. Rob: Archival collection kept together as entity? (Mellon collection, family archives etc). Collection as a set has distinct properties. Could be rules for provenance from collection to individual object (would be difficult and doesn’t work very well). No need to take a stance, institutions could describe collections and if they get to the individual objects then that would work.",Sami - Good to serve both purposes. Archival standards that don’t meet institutions where they’re at - impossible to handle everything as objects. What does an archival object model look like? All are human made objects. Is there an archives extension to LA? ,"Rob- for individual objects we have the correct tools for linguistic objects. Distinction would be a box or example. Box is an object with number has location etc, finding aid useful b/c want to request the box. Could say there is a set of letters that exist. Sami how to describe the physical arrangement of the objects and the intellectual arrangement of the objects. ","Sami place to start is the distinction between physical thing vs intellectual arrangement. Finding aids covers both of those. Boxes and folders seem easier as a starting point. Rob - do we need a relationship between the box and folders (letter example)? Sami - often not a 1 to 1 corollary between physical and individual because have to maximize effort. Rob -  Some relationship between folder that contains some of the letters and the set of letters but not a membership relationship. Folder is not a member, it is a physical holding container. Sami - because some only have collection level cataloging have to be able to connect to the physical container. Daniel, at Getty most is at folder or box level, some are item, but most not. Sami - Multiple objects described in aggregate? Rob -  not that the description describes 5 things, but that it describes 1 and notes there are 4 others. Sami -  Or it could describe 10 things in one item level description. Rob - similar to Natural History practice.

Part refers to object, but parent does not refer to children (would be 1000s of links in parent record then). But as a developer would want to know all of the children records. How do you get from parent to children? Use HAL for underscore links (thanks Dave). Know how to get to from parent to children, but do not know the syntax. Would be nice to have something semantic. Should we use an API or should it be more semantic/specific? Daniel - same issue at Getty, tried to follow pattern of embedding children within parent but that is impossible. Using Sparql as solution, raw JSON-LD in graph store. Only parent reference in child, then get information by querying that way. Does everything have to be semantic, example of Discovery in IIIF. How would one power the API in this case? For Getty exporting from TMS and now static file. No live look ups. If not coming from Sparql would need another database and query that. Benefit to being able to work with data as JSON-LD. Rob: Yale example. LIve query. Daniel: Does Yale run Sparql query for each page? Rob: They are in regular index, look up into an inverted index. Dave: Follow link from August 31 2021 in github chat. Key is from HAL. Any response formatted like this gives a way to navigate at the same level to the next page/set of results. Can drill down look at higher collection level. Purpose of structures is to provide minimal required to allow navigation through an API w/o prior knowledge of API’s capabilities. Rob: Put same data up side by side in Activity Stream model and a HAL model to determine what is the best way to go. Rob will take a stab at that, Dave will check the HAL model. Dave: Question to be answered is how to format a response that contains a list of items? Describe type of query as general search query, how is that search response formatted? We do not know what those searches are yet. Does it make sense to determine what those searches are, and let that inform the type of response. Issue 455 is that issue (Enumerate named queries). API has link from object to artist, but not from artist to all objects produced by them. Would be good to describe all of the possible permutations that would be necessary for LA. Parts of triptych to all objects in a museum (and everything in between). Daniel we build LOD gateway, exposes records as JSON at absolute url and has Activity Stream. Paginates through Activity Stream, user can filter results. Reliant on search index not external system.

Comparison and discussion about how IIIF and Linked Art are similar and different, and bringing together of different communities with common interests. Plan is to follow the IIIF program of Broad to Specific over three days, with outreach then workshop then technical discussion. Still, it turns out, that the Linked Art Data Model needs more simple explanations and catchy sentences for people interested in Linked Art but who are not that near to or familiar with the model yet.","Kevin: I think we could now run 'hands on'/workshop style sessions not just on modelling (how can attendees express their data in Linked Art), but also deployment (or at least approaches to deployment) and scholarship (and our EES project at Edinburgh/Yale/Oxford should have some concrete progress by next September).",Rob: Yale’s transformation/reconciliation work should be openly available by then,Demo:,https://julsraemy.ch/prezi/linkedart-pia.html,"Three teams: Cultural Anthropology, Technology, Design.",PIA Project: https://about.participatory-archives.ch/ ,PIA User Interface Prototype: https://participatory-archives.ch/ ,SSFS Website link: https://archiv.sgv-sstp.ch ,Object detection done through Vitrivr.

Sometimes have physical things (prints etc). Still thinking about correct process. ,Balancing of traditional archival hierarchy. Is this leading to new hierarchies? Sometimes have more metadata for an individual photograph rather than its containing set. Two levels: collection and image. Have to reconstruct images as an album. Other collections may have more structure. ,"Image annotation: How is this achieved and how is the resulting data modeled? Julien notes that Vitrivr is the (open source) image/object recognition software being used (vitrivr.org). It is a project of the Databases and Information Systems research group, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, at the University of Basel. It currently has 100’s of terms in its vocabulary. Its machine learning model was primarily trained on contemporary images, and now more work is being done to train the model with earlier and more varied images. An object detection confidence level of at least 80% was chosen as the threshold for determining whether to include a detected annotation or not. The primary pieces of information stored from the Vitrivr output are the descriptive term associated with the detected object within the image, such as “person” or “cat”, the confidence level, and the X,Y,W,H coordinates associated with the bounding box that would encompass the detected object within the source image that was provided as input to the Vitrivr detection software. The output from Vitrvir in PIA’s implementation is then stored in a SQLite database, which was found to be an easier way to work with the data and makes it easily accessible for incorporation into other uses, such as for generating the Web Annotations that annotate the IIIF Manifests with the recognized object metadata.",IIIF manifests are generated dynamically. LA not yet. ,Please look at github for the agenda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

George will talk with Bree and Karina.,Daniel can do more detailed chat at next opportunity. ,Julien also can do talk about PIA work later. ,Yale (Rob): ,Opposite approach to George. Archives Space better described intellectual hierarchy. Used sets as base instead of Curated Holding. ,https://linked.art/api/1.0/endpoint/set/,Can have additional information added and removed. ,Hierarchy:,Sets - different levels of the archives. Then get to physical items. ,Physical items can be supported by other objects. Held/supported by is relatively new property. (P198) added in version 7. “Archival folder 6 (E22) holds or supports the piece of paper carrying the text of a letter . . . (E22).,Shortcut from physical thing. Do not to create places only to put items into. ,Intellectual hierarchy allowed things to fall into place. Series and subseries. ,Trumbull example. ,Archive is set. Regular pattern follows. ,Doing a search for a concept. The hierarchy has a widget walk up and down. ,Set is member of set. Members exemplified by Object. ,Correspondence is member of Archive. Exemplified by HMO.,Cannot distinguish between physical and intellectual objects in set. Members exemplified by gives example of what is in set. ,Members exemplified by has similar pattern in CRM. ,Sets instead of types. ,Dataset for Lux rebuilt frequently so can change. ,"Richard: Are there links between archives and objects? Eg is the letter discussing the work of art in the museum. Rob: Would not be hard to model. Could use linguistic model, refers to object in museum (or production of object in museum). Richard: Big benefit for V&A. ","Edward: Question about distinction of two approaches, coming from same system. George: not controversial. Shared screen E78 decomposing to item. Conceptually similar.",Rob: sharing backend. Does Sparql queries and full text in elastic way. Does both together and retains relevance ranking. Robinson example. Name is not in record pulled from concept. Can pull from multiple queries and merge them. Includes triples and text. Lists where to find in the Json.

LA possibilities.,"Adam: Getty Javascript library. Asking for people to try it and give feedback. Tremendous benefit at the Getty. Not re-writing central logic pieces. Shared with the broader community. Goal is for everyone to use and contribute. Built for provenance index. Basic and larger helpers built in, not just getting the title or artist. Grammar of LA built into the library. Query to get assigned properties. Relies on user to request the data, but helps with returning the data. Does not construct documents. Does parse for the front end. Used for entire elastic search and the user interface. GitHub repository: https://github.com/thegetty/linkedart.js (please file PRs and issues)",Rob: Compare to IIIF and how it improved with user input. ,Adam: Links in “Getting started” (https://observablehq.com/@jrladd/linked-art-1) gives nice examples how to get started and use it.

Same as sculptor doing the sculpting part. ,"Edward: Did use general purpose type P2?  But were not happy with it. Rob: Vocab tends to be specific, getting classifications to be consistent is hard enough without types and motivations. ","Exchange pattern … is it sufficient to use part_of?https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/489 ","Transfer of an amount of money. In CRM same as object. Can it say what was being paid for? It can but should it? Rob: No, because it would be inconsistent with transfer classes. Paying money is a common scenario, but could also be an exchange of objects (painting swap). The other object performs the same function as the money. Question of payment for different things (900 for painting, 100 for frame). That works: ",overall,painting,ownership: painting (a to b),payment: 900 (b to a),frame,ownership: frame (a to b),payment: 100 (b to a),Could split up the parts of the payment into separate provenance activities.

Use case for the Natural History. Use case from Daniel if some parts are cataloged. Should use API because this would be useful for the researcher. Eg some MS’s cataloged from a folio. ,Are there any other use cases?,"  Large altar with panels, tryptychs with panels, etc."," Part of type (sash doors) Number of parts also want to know type of parts. Can be done with blank instance nodes, but not helpful. If there is enough information should just create records. ",Edward: what if there are an expected number of parts but they are not available? ,"	This is similar to fish use case. Is the description up to the publishing institution? Or just publishing the number? Can always put number of parts in a note. Is there a use case for searching number of parts? Can do that for a string, only real integer. ",George: Dimension pattern allows for assigning dimensions to things. If it is an aggregate thing could use AAT or other term would be consistent (may violate CIDOC CRM) and could be applicable to more than physical things. Apply to vocab terms that could have sets. ,"Rob: SO would not add number of parts, but add dimension. George: Could solve sash window issue. Rob: Dimension E54.",https://cidoc-crm.org/Entity/E54-Dimension/version-7.1.1,Nothing prevents from using Dimension for parts. Could make it clearer as to the types of things. ,Edward: What if one institution has 1 thing and another has 20. Rob: Any publication is relative to knowledge of the publishing institution.  ,"Rob: New proposal, document how to use dimension to list number of parts. Do not add new property, do not add new pattern. Just add vocabulary. Daniel would work in Getty. Can work in dimension, harder to extract. Allow to differentiate different records to query. lIke in terms of clarity. Does not have conflicting use cases. Example of parent record with 10,000 child records. Worked with one-way relationship. Only in child record. Hint in Sparql query, but that was running for everything. Can rework proposal for Getty. ",Rob: Originally had two contexts: LA and helpful CRM. Thought it would be easier to have a validator and have all of CRM available. No LA consumer should care if someone wanted to add number of parts. Did not want to lose semantics. ,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/412,"Can we annotate this issue with number of parts. Zero (there are no parts) 10,000 (be prepared for large query). Could be useful place in structure for the API. ",Daniel: What would be under parts? Or will it be a specialized API response given by the institution. Like obviousness of this and it works in world of JSON. Daniel: Would it still be valid without API hint? Rob: Will be valid. Daniel: Hopefully will be possible to do both approaches. Rob: API hint will work for things other than parts. Eg number of objects that have this type (number of paintings). Advantages for all cases.,George: need to read the scope note. ,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/486 ,Part replaced by part_of,"Same as 10,000 photograph example. Cannot list all of the parts that are known. Answer is “part_of” and see how to use API. ",https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/458 ,Exhibition specific name. Works in model. Disaster for API. Cannot manage all AttributeAssignment also cannot put it on the Object because of different institution.,To be filed away for thinking. Where in API can we put things like this. If we have to change the model that should be done sooner. ,This deals with exhibitions which is useful. ,"Daniel: Not a great way but pattern with exhibition attribute. Loan institution and Owning institution could both publish, is that ok? ",Daniel: Similar to provenance so much metadata on the join between owners.,"Edward: Could it be in context?

Change is greater the higher up in the hierarchy you make changes, as the implications echo downwards. ","Q: Would we be layering/proposing change to that range (extended range), or declaring additional properties in the extension? A: Would need to make new property to accommodate new range of Generic Actors.

Log of things that have happened to that record (how & what has changed). Able to bridge this on top of TMS and other systems to see changes made to object record, pull in edits, and regenerate into Linked Art.","Linked Art showed means to be able to standardize data model across sources, taking from custom schemas to usable, consistent standard","Sourcing information from TMS on object, exhibitions, constituents + open text multimedia manager (DAMS) + content stack, a headless content management system to hold content that doesn’t have a place in TMS (eg. more interpretive in nature, curatorial texts, etc.) – integrating this all together into linked data",Transforming from time-based process to event-based process: change when some change occurs as opposed to a cron job that runs nightly,ID Manager allows for relating different things together ,Exposes links as Web Annotations (another W3C standard),"Sometimes there is compromise, but more benefits than drawbacks to using standards","Gateways allows for access to data without putting strain on source systems that staff rely on (eg.

First call is for the (E22) object, and this has a lot of the information needed to start. Continuing to work on performance improvement, which includes ordering calls, but performance is very good. ",Data coming from LOD Gateway - table/row in Postgres db - so very quick to retrieve it,Also able to do SPARQL queries against data,"Caching JSON-LD documents so not needing to generate on the fly, very quick to retrieve, contributes to site performance",Interesting question came up of how to determine where document boundaries are,"Object record contains information about persons, which are their own record; where is the boundary between these documents? This has been ongoing conversations, about requirements of different teams. Balance of size/quantity/complexity.","If we embed information about the person in the object record, what happens when information about the person changes? Would need to change in each spot. Need to decide how to handle this. Important difference between person and role - role relevant in context of object, requires that context.","Ordering of information - addressed using annotations, dimensions to represent sequence (position 1, 2, etc.). Comes from curatorial needs, level of desire, continue level of control on such things. Need explicit ordering (achieved through annotation) that can then be used on display side for presentation in order.",Q: “More from the Collection” section - what part of the data model activates contents of this section? Finding objects that display similar visual items - is this something the Getty is exploring?,A: Re: similar visual items - not yet.,"Re: “More” - Series of elasticsearch queries on things like Title and Description, or color analysis done on image to get color palette and show things with similar color palettes (background is part of that analysis so look for second most common color). Also Material, Technique; sometimes inverse of what is expected so as to not get too similar results (avoid endless fragments). ","Want variation of types of results, and then display top 6. ",Also monitor clicks to understand which of these queries tend to produce results that people click on.,"Try to encourage serendipity, exploration; big part of redesign as well.",Q: ID Manager - is this going to be public or open source?,"A: Definitely scope for that as it is a generic service and hopefully easily usable by others; other systems developed as part of this project, such as the data transforms are hopefully and likely informative for others but not necessarily as easily reused in different contexts due to the specifics of sourcing the data from internal systems and then mapping to Linked.art. Current conversations are around making LOD Gateways open source, but the ID Manager is also in scope of generic things built that could be useful for others.","Have built a couple of OpenRefine integrations with source systems for staff to use and approve relationships from source data.

DPhil vacancy for start of the academic year. ",Issues,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/479,Three main:,Transfer class: Do not know if ownership/custody was transferred with object. Payment and Rights could be under this superclass. Would be a way to do joint ownership and asymmetrical amounts. More consistent terminology “transferred from” “transferred to” would all be sub-properties of “transfer”. ,Set. Not curated holdings. But would be useful to document and add/remove from sets. Set should be higher in hierarchy than Group. Especially for non-human actors. ,Statement. Meta classification on type of note. Hard to distinguish linguistic objects in a graph. Separate class would help with distinction in linguistic objects. Could use “referred to by” Drop the metaclassification because referred to by class. And clearer for JSON. Making “statement” and new class would go along with the hierarchy. Not making it a new class would not have the RDF benefits but easier for JSON.,Should we work on ontology? Or only work on profiling? ,"Kevin: Could be a slippery slope by working on ontology. Would CRM ever merge this in? Or is this a temporary ontology? Rob: Given work with ISO, ISO 7.1 is completely stable, so it will be hard for several years to make major changes. No enthusiasm for “set” or “non-human actors” in ISO 7. Probably no movement for 3 years. Kevin: 3 years not inappropriate about of time, would it merge after that? Rob: Could add to LA, and could result in more people coming to LA to add their ideas. Erin: 3 years is accurate. Philippe and I are working with ISO and could have answers in next 6 weeks. Is this an all or nothing question? Rob: Not possible for it to be all or nothing. Could be significant changes in adoption. Observable component being discussed by CRM. Time is observable, concepts are not. This has been there for some time. Precedents for changing the extensions in the hierarchy. And precedent for bringing things into PSY that are not in base. Erin: would LA maintain this independently forever? Rob: Reasonable, horrifying thought. LA could determine it is essential and CRM determine it is out of scope. Not that big a burden if LA writes out the ontology. Dave: Would it have effect on release of version 1.0? Rob: “Statement” would have huge effect, Statement class instead of LinguisticObject. The others would not have a big effect. Could use super property of “transfer” in RDF. But probably should not do because splitting from CRM. Transfer, Set, Non Human Actors would not have effect on release. Kevin: Sensible to split Statement then. Bree: is the length of time between creating these and possible acceptance into CRM an advantage especially if these become fundamental additions? Gives more leverage for adding to CRM. How bad is it to add in and then remove? Rob: Let’s not consider Statement for now. Advantage for use. Value in doing it sooner. Could go to 2.0 or 1.x if not breaking at JSON. Richard: Should we bring the people to decide this into a room to reach agreement? Rob: Maybe add a day to Edinburgh. May not be possible. Have this on part of an ontology call. Lots of interest in this as a call.",Kevin: How to deal with Statement. Should be resolved before 1.0. Flag a meeting so everyone attends? Rob: Maybe we do not want to re-write every LA record for something that will not go into CRM. Querying could be better. If we are to do it should be in 0.9. Maybe call on May 4. ,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/478 ,"Cannot have different identifiers for the same object. Cannot put “identified_by” on identifiers. Cannot currently have a display label for a name. Should we add “identified_by” for the Identifier and Name classes? Daniel: Is there a technical reason why not? We use “classified_by” currently. Rob: Two accession number examples: OCLC and LoC example. The identified_by property is  recursive but we already have that issue. Daniel: It would be useful and no known likely clashes as it hasn’t been available previously. Rob: Not to avoid a type, but so interface is easier or more appropriate if all it has is type. Also works for dimensions. Daniel: Use of “identified_by” shouldn’t replace the use of “classified_by”, but because of institution labeling differences its availability would be useful, as different institutions could use the same classification such as “accession number” (AAT 300312355), while adding their own custom display label for that term, via the “identified_by” property, such as “Yale Accession Number”, “Getty Museum Object Number” or “Frick Accession Number”. Rob: The addition of “identified_by” would also useful if the specific form of say a Name is unknown, i.e. we don’t have required classifications, rather they are just recommended, as that could lead to the use of generic classifications such as classifying a “note” as a “note” when it wasn’t possible to be more specific, which doesn’t add much value to the data. Instead the availability of “identified_by” would allow more clarity and specificity to be provided in the data in a human readable way, without necessitating the creation of custom classifications and the infrastructure needed to support their retrieval (dereferencing) and use.","Daniel: Getty is replacing the Museum Collection site with our brand-new Linked.art and IIIF LOD-based version tomorrow (March 24th) – links to the Linked.art LOD records and IIIF manifests are also included in most of the new web pages, so will allow anyone who is curious to explore those too. The site may be found here: https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/ – feel free to explore and any feedback or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

There are different editions of the film, a .WARC archived file, pattern designs (jpgs), image clips and stills, work in progress 3D data, soundtrack (which also exists as a physical EP)","RS: There is the work and also various inputs, ways the inputs get used. Some parts are separate (gifs, snapshots, etc.) ","In discussing the difference between these things, the final object tends to be the only thing catalogued with the other elements part of archive; workshop found that all elements should be included as part of the acquisition and not put in an archive separately. This leads to questions - what *is* the object? ","Hybrid objects (eg. case study 3, y-stop, a smartphone app that is also a printed leaflet and a website and a community). This brings up some of the biggest problems of what *is* the object that is being acquired. Method (habit?) of using physical objects as a proxy for the whole. ","RS: The CRM would be able to capture a lot of the sort of thing given event and activity focus. Eg. community activity can be identified, community and its participants can be identified. Hope this one could be identified thoroughly. ",RP: What is the actual object in this that is being acquired? Is it the concept of the y-stop project that is being acquired? ,There is… ,An app,A website,A community,A printed leaflet,"There is text that is on the leaflet, the app, and the website. Are the differences in these texts important? Likely yes, because it is ongoing and revised as the project evolves. Going to leave versions for now. Leaflet will only carry 1 version while app and website can be updated. Abstract text vs. versions. When is it something new? Ship of Theseus ;) ",Can conceptual things be modified? Classes like Modification are for physical. ,"TV: What is it that is changed? Is it the conceptual thing, or the digital object - the app or website? ",RS: What if the text versions P16_used_object the conceptual text?,RP: What is the conceptual text(work)? RS: The intent of the authors. There has to be some abstract thing that the texts are representations/editions of. RP: This brings us back to the idea of the project. ,"DB: Is it possible to say what change was made, the resulting project from the change, and go through that path to track the progression of the item?",RP: What would the app be classified as in Linked Art? Is it the representation of the object? RS: So the app as a work vs. the app as a file sitting on a disc? RP: Yes. ,"TV: Suggest looking at CRMdig. There are events such as Digital Machine Events for modifying files, that is a Modification and Creation. You can use this to track website/file changes, and use CRM properties to connect this to different versions of the text.","RS: Linked Art only uses D1 from CRMdig, but as app/website would be D1, could use those properties, etc. ",RS: App representation of work is digitally carried by the various copies of the app. You can modify the file. ,RP: Has this then shifted to the question of what is the app as the thing? ,"RS: Yes, but we can more easily point to things with identity and say that the app_version has a format, file location, etc., and app_concept can be summarized. ",RP: App representation of work/text work is where future work is required (as opposed to what can already fit). Seems like CRMdig could help cover information around process and workflows - images to 3D models to films and so on. There is also a discussion from preservation side for digital preservation and conservation workflows. ,"RS: This might help with that. When you do digital preservation and you transform format (eg. doc > pdf), it is the creation of the PDF. In CRMdig (Machine Events?) there is a property for “takes as input” as opposed to P16.

UI uses the set instead of figuring out the hierarchy. Dave: Scalability for numerous terms? May miss applying a term at appropriate depth, when seeing so many terms in a flat list. Rob: That would be a local cataloging decision. A drop down list would have to have both terms (oil painting & painting). Dave: For validation purposes, is it correct to look at the “member_of” and not any particular branch? Rob: To validate look to the “member_of”. Dave: colors as example, all hues of green would. Rob: AAT is a poly-hierarchy. So not a 1 to 1 correlation. A lot are under categories of information but not all. Anticipate a warning statement for classification. ",Dave: Where are the correct terms. Rob: Need to create this. See issue #186 and spreadsheet. Dave: List will be extended when LA is validated. Commented but will not close until started to be implemented.,Dave: Validator should be able to run locally. Objective is to be self-contained. Can add another folder for things like local terms. Daniel: May need an intermediary for local terms. Some terms are too specific. Should be straightforward to add a layer between AAT and a JSON file with local terms. Could share with Greg would does API endpoints for AAT. , [kitten meowing],https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/461,Differentiate use of classification term between two objects loaded into a graph,Daniel: Has spreadsheet. For major types can find a match in AAT. But how can we be sure a consumer is choosing the correct term. ,"Dave: What if “classified_as” were absent. ID and type are required. Classified_as would not be present would only add a URI to the term. Two rules: There should not be further classifying of terms? And Should there be a check so there are not invalid assertions at the global level. Rob: Have metaclassifications. So when multiple are assigned to one entity there is a work around. In a more expressive ontology would not need that. Since we do not have those, so long as a label is possible then id is generated. Cannot get rid of two layer classification. Daniel: running a validator would check. Have used attribute assignment to avoid making a classification globally true. ",Rob: Having global metatypes allows for interoperability. In a local system could tag all types as part of set. Dave: Concerning metatype need to know structure of collection. ,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/462,Discussed in slack.,"When the JSON-LD data below is loaded into a graph, the rdfs:domain statement above seems to add the class E33_Linguistic_Object to the ""Place"" subject having the ""language"" predicate.","Rob: Do not rely on inferencing in the model. Human made object compared to physical object. Would need to know that hierarchy. Dave: is it necessary to specify a range in the model, or could it be removed? Rob: Could be removed locally. But do want place have language predicate to fail in validation. Dave: Remove statement in the xml. Rob: another test could be if the class of the entity is not the subclass of the domain then it is an error. Could test after inferencing of domain has the domain gained any new types, then the inferencing did something we do not want. Dave: See if the graph is isomorphic after inferencing? Rob: It would have gained another node in this case. Dave: When does the inference come into play, in writing out the graph or only in querying? Try to remove inferencing and if it is still an issue then find another solution.",https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/463,Rob: Similar to first issue (#460). Dave: Sounds like it should be resolved by approach to types.,Rob: Same term can be in multiple sets at the same time.,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/464,"Rob: This is a bug in the documentation. Example of multiple homepages in different languages. Should not allow “digital object” whenever textual work is permitted as “subject_of”. Also ran into this with IIIF manifests. Two different versions of same content (one version 2, one version 3 for example).

Today is LRM day. Expect how to bring modeling in the new future. (agenda),Issue 473,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/473 ,Issue of provenance if the holder was the actual owner. CRM has transfer of custody but cannot discuss transfer without saying what type of transfer it is.,"In Linked Art there is a way to describe it with an extension but is terrible. There is an exchange but not physical eg copyright. Right acquisition was created but not expected to be used very often. Establishes a right, but do not know what type of right it is. Subject to any sort of law so it is broad. This is a way to do it with changing class hierarchy in CRM. Consignment, ownership, physical possession are examples. Edward: also has unclear transfers. Bree: Could we have a new label instead of a new method. Rob: Have ownership and custody and physical movement. In CRM these are all subsets of Activity. Could do a LA transfer (maybe an acquisition maybe a transfer of custody) but it would not be a new class. Edward is using E7 too ambiguous? Rob: No way to describe the actors. Erin: Example of theft? Rob: Theft is tricky because if thief sells, it is not a legal transfer but it would be modeled that way. Cannot solve that. Bree: so options are the not great solution or new class? Daniel: Could this apply to any stage in recorded provenance history? Question of gaps in recorded history. Can this apply to anywhere in the chain of provenance? Rob: Acquisition does not need the previous owner. Can leave off the previous owner or the date etc. Charlie This causes a lot of impedance mismatch in historical datasets -- between theft, consignment, and other ambiguous transfers CRM's class hierarchy does not match the actual data space particularly well. Edward is E7 too vague? Rob: Can not link it together. It would be better than nothing or better than right acquisition pattern. ","Three options: Put in existing; new class (transfer of new right), issue there is injecting it into the CRM hierarchy; go with terrible, but semantically correct right acquisition. Daniel: Can right acquisition fit with existing provenance pattern? Rob: They are intentionally compatible. It would be nice to have that interstitial class. Could then stop using transfer “title” “custody” could just do transfer to/from. Kevin: have the limitations of how to articulate provenance. Difficulties in CRM. Needs work. How does this affect LA? Can we note in LA that this is a stopgap and at some point there will be a version 2 and extensions. Rob: In CRM extensions there are some that inject into the regular hierarchy. Observable Entity S15 injected between E1 and E2. Kevin: Suspect will have support, issue is time. Should start but need to have expectations on completing it. Rob: there is a freeze on ISO. Kevin: Possible workshop on provenance in LA? Rob: Will not be in CRM any time soon. Could put into LA and cite that. Should we go that route? Could ask Lynn Rother or Kelly at Getty for further challenges in provenance. ",Sketch out solution for further examples to see how it aligns with complicated use cases.,Bree: Do we want to put a holding place for CRM Sig?

For example, here is a mapper for Wikidata > Linked Art. When it is all up and running, and have a data engineer to run tests for it, will push to open source.","Identifier Map section of the pipeline. Nothing proprietary about this, could be released/reused for mapping identities across linked data sources.",Merge process can introduce things like different birth or death dates for a single individual based on multiple data sources,Dave: Are you tracking what data came from which sources? ,"Rob: No; if we need to figure out where information came from, we can trace through compiled identifiers. But this is would be a pain if you had to manually reverse-engineer where it can from, so what we intend to do is to use cache from data when imported to run same front-end client over that cache. Ultimately, leaving backtracking to a human with support of appropriate tooling.",(In response to question from Edward) Middleware handles moving results of SPARQL query into JSON object,Can modify query in browser by adding profile=”...” to get a subset of the results based on the defined profile. Currently have 3 established. ,Dave: How many folks are working on this? ,"Rob: Rob on pipeline; a front-end developer working on react client that consumes results and produces html; have consulting architect at MarkLogic; a sysadmin managing MarkLogic on AWS; Song making middleware and helping on frontend; project manager; team lead for software engineering; all of the people in the collecting units (galleries, museums, libraries, archives that data is coming from) who implement mappings - 2 or 3, up to 5, in each unit working on this",Rob: Want to make a system that is useful for people who want to know what they can see at different museums at the same time but don’t care about extensive details as well as for art historians and researchers wanting to do extensive queries. Data is not perfect; trying to update via enrichment and looking to external sources to have more information but also not be entirely trusting of them. ,Tanya: Are you working with data experts to resolve conflicts from external data sources? ,"Rob: Not at present. Due to volume, have to automate and then provide feedback mechanisms for folks to flag errors.","Dave: If you would to release as open source and someone wanted to use it without MarkLogic, how feasible would that be? ","Rob: Somewhat. Will release javascript and react pieces when closer to being done, so if you have Linked Art it will work; the MarkLogic part would be worthless unless you are also using MarkLogic. Customized gradle to do fun and fancy things with MarkLogic but not hugely reusable. Middleware wrapper tries to be MarkLogic-neutral so that piece should be potentially reusable.",Julien: Are you thinking about using the open refine reconciliation service api?,"Rob: At the moment, no.",Daniel: When did this work start? ,"Rob: Joined Yale in September 2020; at the time they had an in-house Solr schema they weren’t happy with.

Project will both create and consume Linked Art data.",Kevin: Thanks to all the letters of support.,Jonathan: Interested if there’s an open call for source requiring analysis.,Issue 453,"Relates to sociological events: baptism, burial, marriage.","Rob: we do have some related patterns: professional activities, conservation work, etc. However, life events have not yet been considered. There may be a reasonably easy way for them, however, to be included in the data. For example – by adding a classification, with the caveat that you cannot carry out your own burial. The new participated in property in CRM may also be useful. Activities could have parts to divide the classifications of who performed what. Feels overly detailed for something that isn’t directly art-related. Options: add participated in to the model; or defer to waiting for CRMsoc to fulfill the requirement?",Richard: is there a difference between what we’re saying biographically about someone and what they might be depicted doing in an artwork?,Rob: if you wanted describe a painting of the baptism of Napoleon. And it’s an entirely fictional scene. Then you need to say that the VisualItem represents an Event with Napoleon participating in baptism. Classifying the reality of the event is not our concern.,Richard: thinking of staged photography. Might be an artist depicted doing things which didn’t happen in their real life.,"Julien (from the chat): An overall question perhaps, when a property from CIDOC-CRM is integrated into Linked Art, is the inverse property also being integrated automatically?",Rob: Not automatically. Also intentionally not always so that path navigation is clearer.,Rob: any objections to including the event participation stuff?,Kevin: anxious that this is the thin end of a scope-creep wedge for parts of a model which Linked Art won’t be responsible for.,Rob: there are good use cases: e.g. went on an art collecting tour. Some events which aren’t really art are actually still useful when you want to talk about the art or its participants.,"Kevin: at what point should this be farmed out to people responsible for describing those things? But yes, utility wins.",Antoine: why P11 and not P12 from the CRM? Could be that it’s quite difficult to make the distinction. Must say that I’m a bit guilty about (?) not implementing this in the Europeana Data Model.,Rob: there’s a balance between active / passive to strike. Imagine a bubble in which an event is occurring. The sinking of the Titanic occurred in the presence of some water. And an iceberg. It’s not especially interesting although it may be true. The painting of the sitter occurred in the presence of the seat the sitter was sitting on. Describing participation is overall more interesting.,"Antoine: it does address some doubts, which is good. But it does bring us towards having some opinion on what counts in someone’s biography and potentially straying out of scope.","Rob: at least for this use-case, we do know that they are participants rather than just present. Who carries out an auction? Is it only the auctioneer? If you are in the audience are you a participant or does it occur in your presence? Agree– difficult to distinguish. People will probably decide according to their own interpretation.","Antoine: for EDM, we did mint a semantically-equivalent property for P12. We knew we couldn’t capture all the available roles, so we picked the most general. Just some kind of involvement in an event. Suppose that P11 is general and P14 is a specialisation of P11? P12 would answer Sjors’ use case without committing to too much semantics. We can go for P11, but does this level bring us something of value?","Rob: P12 vs P11. Primary distinction is that P11 is the range, for actors. P12 is for anything, which could include actors. But they’re both passive, not active. If we went for P12, then we should scope it to more than just actors.",Bree: Would it apply to the participants in marina abramovic work where they are sitting across from her or actively participating in other pieces of her work?,Thanasis: also my understanding. P14 does have an implication of intention to participate in the event. But it may be interpreted slightly wider than that. RE: Bree’s case (from the chat)-- the result of people’s presence may be causal. Perhaps what we are talking about is P14 with a defined role. Not too much overhead to define another property. ,Thanasis: burial is a problem because the object being buried is no longer a person.,"Rob: if you were ever a person, immediately after you die, you are still a person.",Thanasis: ah OK. That’s cheating.,Rob: absolutely it is. But it is in the docs :),Thanasis: maybe we don’t need to introduce a new property in that case.,Rob: the child (or party)’s participation is necessary or the event cannot be carried out.,Thanasis (from the chat): we should remove P14 and have only P12 ;-),Rob: we don’t want to introduce complexity for the sake of absolute purity.,"Rob: we can embark on some data collection. What data do we actually have other than getting married and going on holiday? Also, Thanasis, can we ask Martin how he interprets causal here.",Rob: “This property describes the active participation of an instance of E39 Actor in an instance of E7 Activity. It implies causal or legal responsibility.”,"Thanasis: the scope note does imply legal (or something else, didn’t hear) responsibility. Looks like the scope note could use some clarifying improvement.",Rob: will email SIG. Folks please look at what other event data you have about people who are involved in art which would be useful to record in a Linked Art context. Then we can adjudicate on the nature of involvement and later decide on which property to use.,Issue 460,Dave: this is a question about the Linked Art data service from the Getty. What exactly are we hoping to get out of this and how will it help?,Rob: the Type definition spec should be implemented as a real API. There’s a long history about whether broader should be pure CRM or skos. Some disparity between the Linked Art spec and the current implementation of the Getty data.,Dave: so this is so we can extend below the AAT with custom concepts.,Rob: yes.,"Rob: then, member of, is the inclusion of the concept in some set. For example, types of name (display, sorting, etc). There’s not necessarily a broader concept.","Dave: ah, yes, creating a set from a hierarchy.","Daniel: there have been cases where we haven’t been able to find a term in AAT. Usually we go to the maintainers, and ask for inclusion. Sometimes this isn’t possible and information is specific to our own data model. So we are creating a local thesaurus. Perhaps this particular pattern would be helpful more widely. We are not modelling out the AAT data, simply referring to the concepts as IDs.",Rob: you can definitely use this as a pattern now. It should work fine. Types should be moved in the docs from the Shared section into the main Endpoints section.,Issue 461,Dave: noticed that if a Concept is sub-classified in different graphs then the context is lost in a complete graph. All the metatypes merge. The context is always available in the JSON but when it’s pulled together it’s merged in the graph. Does this break the model?,"Rob: The example in the issue, in particular, is an erroneous conflict. However, yes, it is possible to encounter this issue. Absolutely a problem.",Dave: should we move the Type classifications into the Concepts endpoint?,"Daniel: when we’re in this situation, then we need to use an AttributeAssignment, using the assigned property and giving a classification too. That way your assertion is context-specific.","Rob: RE: should the metatypes be in a different document? This would make it easier to see, but the rationale is that you want to be able to filter the classifications. We also don’t want to require understanding of all the specific AAT statements. The metatype enables a user to display/process unknown specific classifications by interpreting a handful of known metatypes (brief text, etc.). ",Rob: the vocabulary is also still not finalised. Issue is outstanding.,Daniel: noticed that Description is classified as a brief text. Getty have been assigning multiple types and not metatypes.,Rob: this was a valid pattern but at some point we switched to requiring nesting; so Getty will need to adapt at some point.

Adding things rather than changing things. New version with incompatibilities every 3 years or so.,	Validator for 1.0 (is the Linked.Art or not?). ,Open issues which ones are critical for 1.0.

Some terms need to be consistent within LA. Mandated vocabulary that stands in for ontology. Exhibition / Primary name examples. ,Required:,	Metatypes: Flag for bucket type. Do not need to list every example but show what.,	Replacements for Ontology.,	Trivally Enumerable Sets (height etc),	API distinguishing terms.,Recommended:,	Enumerable sets,	Terms that come up commonly,Term document: ,Have a JSON-LD vocabulary available? Outgoing request without having to use AAT id. ,Initial thought was to just have uri not term. So look up of how to get to uri? Separate document? Criteria needs to be consistent and have justification. Also useful for someone who needs to document their data if it is different.,Perhaps another way to distinguish the three levels:,"Required: You have to use these or consuming applications will do the wrong thing. Most useful to software engineers writing clients and transformation pipelines, and people doing mappings of data / database structures.","Recommended: Classifications that could reasonably be expected to be produced during a data transformation, either by looking at fields in the incoming data and hard coding, or looking at values in the incoming data and getting the value from a lookup table. Most useful to people doing mappings of data / database structures.","Listed: Anything else that might be useful, but probably will need to be recorded directly in the data management system, over which we probably have no control or resources to change. Informative list of useful identifiers, most useful to people describing objects in a compatible system and admins of such a system.","Is this the correct rubric? Who are we trying to make this easy for? Do not have to prefix anything for it to be an alias. Protocol vs type. Changing from uri to abstraction is a big step. Conduit to the community, separate but public. Somethings may only change with the LA version but have to be pinned. Different levels of choice. Not needed to follow the uri is a reason to have label type. JSON LD has flexibility with alias. For most cases will have to process uri. ",Readable LA URI not aat number? Context document for strings that are not uri’s. JSON LD expansion tool not useful for large sets. Framing algorithm may need to have uri’s in JSON LD. Round tripping to RDF should work. ,Three buckets:,"	Mandatory / Required, Recommended, Other / Listed.",Options for structure for required:,	Stick with AAT,	Make LA uri / text,	Investigate what happens when real aliases are put in. ,Some of this can be improved by tooling. Build libraries to fill in required. And will help with local customization. ,Perceived benefits of local uri. Avoid AAT numbers. ,	Support short aliases on AAT url?,	But number URI are language agnostic. ,	UID also resolves issue of concept versus label. Aliases can be interpreted in different ways. ,	Numbers provide a level of certainty. ,	If definitions change (Auction example in AAT) this is benefit of local terms. Could use a numeric value locally too. ,	Cannot change definition without a new version. ,"	Not enough to have local AL api if AAT is tweaked. Similar problem with CRM, sig does not follow semantic versioning. Could pin what version of LA is used and announce what changes are made in new versions. ",For required terminology.

The number of arrangements and parts and the forces that were in motion all have an impact. For example at PMA, the Dancing with the Bride, and there is a performance piece that is associated, as well as an Exhibition with the same name.","When we get to music, we cannot rule it in or out, and the opinions would vary depending on whether you speak to music librarians versus musicologists.",So long as abstract works can be parts of and/or related to other abstract works we would be able to represent the data in a meaningful way.,"The conclusion is to create a new endpoint “Abstract Works” (loosely based on the documentation for “Textual Works” with the references to the invalid properties – content, format and language – removed) and updated with examples to show how to document an Exhibition (a common use case) as well as some other potential use cases such as performance art, musical performances, etc., and recommending the use of relevant classifications for the PropositionalObject when using it to hold the concept for particular things, such as “exhibition (associated concept)” 300417531).",Issue #419 - members_exemplified_by property for Set?,"This issue asks if we should consider adding a members_exemplified_by property to the Set class? There are many uses for this, for example, noting the holotype – the organism that represents the species – or noting curatorial highlights that are representative of a given collection.","If you have a “hero” object in a collection and you want to say here is a good example of this 70,000 item numismatic collection, then here is a good example of an item or a subset of items from this collection - there are cases where you don’t need to see every example of a collection, where calling out a subset of interest would provide a large portion of the same information.","Can we accommodate both with the same property as we did using the same pattern as we did for transclusions, where a one-off MUST NOT have an id property, but if there are cases where we want to reuse the record, we would need to create the Set as a separate record.","Can this potentially encompass events or activities because one of the things that was encountered in the modeling around is we know in a period of time that things happened within a Set - we know it was here, and then later we know it was somewhere else, but there is a gap between and we don’t know what happened during the time period gap, but there was a desire to model the gap so that as more research is conducted that there would be a place to attach information to. Would this help address this need too?","The Set class is effectively a mathematical set, so it can contain anything, but you wouldn’t be able to define the boundaries. You may be able to create activities and note that the Set participated within the activities.",It is someone’s judgment that these things belong together.,"Decision: Yes, we should include members_exemplified_by","There will be a documented template to use that follows the structure described for transclusions. There are lots of use cases for this property so it should be quite useful to have. If someone wanted to provide a short-cut to an image to visually represent the Set, one could use the representation property directly on the Set class instance to reference an image.",Issue #502 – Alignment of intellectual and physical hierarchy in Archives,"From the issue “In archives, there are two competing and overlapping hierarchies - the intellectual arrangement and the physical location of the items. This is a modeling issue because the items which participate in those hierarchies are also frequently not identified or described individually.”",I think we can boil the modeling issue down to the following:,A recommendation for the missing relationship property (between the Intellectual Set and the Container) was proposed as contains_members_of – are we happy that this property should be named and used as described in the issue ticket?,The contains_members_of property would allow Containers to be associated with multiple Intellectual Sets and vice-versa.,Making sure that there is a good listing of recommended classifiers for taking DAX terms and translating them into Linked.art terms/patterns.,The intellectual sets can often end up being the entry points and the physical handling side would more likely tend to be in the background unless of course you were wanting to know where the physical objects are to go and retrieve them.,Are we thinking about this as a physical arrangement or an intellectual representation?,Decision: Yes to adding contains_members_of to 1.0 and document its availability and usage with some examples.,Issue #411 & #507 – Transcliusions and Identifiers – Are blank nodes ever allowed to have IDs given the presence/absence of IDs are being used in the Transclusions use case?,"Embedded textual references versus actual records in the API, it MUST NOT have an id, which makes it a blank node, and there are 4-5 patterns where we would need to follow this pattern.","Can things like Name,  Identifier, or LinguisticObject, be embedded within a document?","Decision: No sub-graph IDs – may have to find alternative graph expansion library to PyLD, as it sometimes has issues with blank nodes, for example restarting the blank node ID counter for each new document, unless you process all the documents together, which results in the blank nodes in the graph having the non-unique IDs.",Issue #N/A – Versioning,Working out where the boundaries are for what the impacts are when the versions change?,Tracking minor versions is going to be too large of an impediment?,What can change and to whom does it matter?,We have the model,We have the API,We have the set of expected vocabulary,Versioning for the model versus the API?,"If something changed in say the API, a new thing that we could transclude, it wouldn’t affect the model, so that does not need the model version to change, but it should result in the API version changing. There are also changes that could occur at the model level, that may not require the API version to change.",We may revisit extension versioning in the future.,In _links we will have la:model version la:api version and local version which ideally points to documentation about the model and versioning used.,Issue #461 – Classification of entities in the Graph vs in the Document,To be discussed at an upcoming call - 31 May?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",Paris meeting b/c of Anne’s move to Dresden no local coordinator. Saskia has offered Rijks as a host. Likely would be 1 day for public and 1 to 1.5 days of LA discussions. Will avoid overlap with CIDOC. EuropeanaTech Conference in The Hague 10-12 October (https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference#about-europeana-2023). IIIF 3D Basel 25 October (https://www.dasch.swiss/post/daschcon-on-iiif-3d-interoperability).  ,Van Gogh Museum is LA. ,Rob will respond to Saskia and see if it can be aligned with EuropeanaTech. ,"Richard is using Jolt framework. JSON transformation based on template. Now using XSLT version 3. Read in JSON source file and put out JSON result. For going into LA. Knowledge Integration has CIIM acts as middle to produce JSON output. Converting to LA and JSkos. If this works for National Gallery, then others could adopt this approach and have a LA interface. Similar to EODEM for Cidoc. Works for borrowing and lending of objects in institutions. If while in early adopter stage then opens the door for other institutions. Collections Trust also uses it as data stack. Work with Art UK as a stakeholder. LA could work with Collections Trust, Art UK, Knowledge Integration to use LA. Richard has had conversations with Kevin Gosling about using this. Prototype had usual problems with data from multiple institutions. LA does have greater hope because it generalizes down to same object. Rob and Kevin Page had conversation with Kevin Gosling about this topic. Collections Trust wants to get all data in and then decide what they can and cannot do with it. Possible funding from AHRC, Oxford has until next April to apply for follow on funding. What does it look like to have the csv’s from 600 museums? Use machine learning for similar columns to provide mapping. Maybe branch off of Art UK’s enhancement to transform to LA. George: looking at building out, collaborating with Max Planck institute, going to build Arches version to compile data model patterns. Point is to create registers. Have an accurate version of what LA to tell machine learning what the columns are supposed to look like. ","George and Alyssa, checking re-documenation of LA documentation to make sure it aligns with website. And then making a version of Arches that aligns with this so people can use it. In documentation, there are properties colored orange. New to George. How does LA evolve as other projects use it? Question of long term growth of LA. O’Keeffe example, very early and things have moved since adoption. After Lux, need to get documentation for 1.0 out and it is not going to change for 18 months. After that things should be backwards compatible. George when it comes time to lock LA, could we bring in things like Shaql. Documented extensions will be very valuable. Languages spoken by a person is one example. Is there an intersection with Arches modeling group? Arches Resource Model Working Group, has created some patterns that do look like LA. Users can add specific packages of models that relate to their work (archaeology excavation for example). Goal of working group to make sure the patterns are actually LA patterns. ",Kelly and Rob have been working on a LUX model should compare with Arches. ,Would be good to do a comparison of data sets. Does documentation on site relate to what people are actually doing. Changes versus additions. ,Anyone else using Arches? Richard considered it for archives but no funding. ,Topics at Face to Face? Archives as documentation task rather than discussion task. Exhibitions group will be there Monday/Tuesday. And anything else to move closer to 1.0. Can likely set up Zoom for slightly hybrid. But hybrid discussion is less ideal. ,"LUX has been reconciling places. But there are books about space, so generating hierarchies all the way to the universe.

Anne has moved from Paris to Dresden so loss of local organizer. Increasingly unlikely for this to happen. Richard has tried to get Régis Robineau (Biblissima) involved but unlikely. Perhaps Amsterdam (Edward?). Should keep in mind outreach activities.,Almost functioning advanced search with graph queries could be shown at the end of this call.,https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/502,Need sets as primary pattern. Can be both digital things and physical things in archival construct. Need alignment of multiple physical items. “Contains members of”. Do not think there is another predicate in CRM for this. Set is a Linked Art class. Proposal is to mint in the Linked art space a “Contains members of” / “Holds members” property. Otherwise difficult to keep things in alignment b/c they are not 1 to 1. Julien agrees. ,"This new property goes from the physical to the intellectual. There could be no items, but know it is held somewhere. Alternatively know certain items are in folders, in box, in room etc. Box 3, folder 12 holds/contains letters. Can also say Box 3 holds folder 12. Members of archive are at bottom. Sami: hard to go from theoretical to actual collection. The DAMS contains the items. In this example part of a folder is known but no intellectual information. Richard: Upcoming project could make this more concrete in practice. Sami: If using ArchiveSpace or Access to Memory then would have this all in one system. What are the opportunities for inference? Rob: Inferencing can cause more problems, example of if listed in two places. Going up is easier. Downward inferencing is attractive but more problematic. Much of this is re-application of the model. Daniel: Sense of when this would be available? Rob: Lack of alignment in Netlify and Macdocs code so not immediate. Live will take time. ","Edward: Names not conforming to conventions. Capitalization of parts of name as example. Signaling the conformity may be preferable. If the user understands the cataloging standard they can convert the name to their standards. Can we use “classifed as”? Rob: Use “inverted terms” in AAT. Natural order terms is opposite. Sort term also used, not necessarily inverted (removing articles etc). Refers back to https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/186  ",Are there other cases when we want to know the rules? Probably do not need to yet. Have also used name parts. If consuming application does not like order it can reconstruct it. Julien: Is it fine to use other vocabularies? Rob: If there is no consistency between datasets then interoperability is hard. Userface will now know what to render. Some vocabulary should be definition as must be used. Consuming applications must be able to confirm that they are the same. So many standards that cannot force that AAT is only used. Must be normative in some way that if you have a certain case then a certain vocabulary must be used. No way to say here is all of the vocabulary one will ever need. Daniel: Have seen patterns not in AAT and editors have been receptive to creating new names. Julien: consider pronouns (e.g. using https://homosaurus.org/)? Definitely. Daniel: can also classify things with multiple vocabularies. Example of using a local thesaurus term and then getting it added to AAT. Not much overlap to have both. ,Demo of advanced search in LUX.,Deployed yesterday afternoon!,1 minute timeout.

It can be a little tricky to get to New Haven, Connecticut, but flying into one of the New York airports (about 1hr 45 - 2 hrs) or Hartford, Connecticut (about an 1hr drive) are options; there are various train to New Haven for instance too; there may also be some possibility for attendees to share a car to New Haven if arriving at the same airport around the same time. The sooner people can let Rob know if they would like to attend that can help with regards to Yale potentially assisting with accommodation for the Linked.art face-to-face meeting.","Yale’s LUX Project launch is scheduled for Tuesday, May 16th at 4pm, followed by a reception.","The Enriching Exhibitions Meeting is scheduled for Monday, May 15th and Tuesday, May 16th, so some people may be present at Yale for most of the week for the various meetings and events.","There is also the hope to have a face-to-face meeting in September in Paris, France, however, Anne has been thus far leading and seeking local Parisian organizations to get involved, but not clear if there is any progress currently, hopefully more details forthcoming in the next month or so. Hopeful but tentative.",Modeling Archives (https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/502),"Richard documented some examples of archival cases from the V&As archives (documented in the GitHub Issue linked above), including some edge cases, such as archives being split between different storage venues which happened for various reasons.","The intellectual ordering in some cases is different from the physical ordering, as a result of accruals, with parts of the archive coming in over time, so where and how they are stored, doesn’t necessarily reflect the intellectual ordering of the archive as a whole.",Born digital archives were another example where there is a mixture of born-digital items and paper items.,"How do we model both at once? Is it important to represent both the intellectual ordering and the physical ordering; if we only modeled one, then the other would not be represented.","For the archives, they can split up into different boxes, even though they should be kept together. Sometimes additional boxes that should be part of the archive were misplaced, and then later found.","Jessica shared that the intellectual arrangement tends to be more important to the archivist, versus the physical arrangement which is more important to the end user.","What is important to the archivist isn’t necessarily important to the end user who just wants to see the item, i.e. where it is on a shelf is more important for access and viewing, than how it is intellectually arranged, which tends to be more conceptual.","It could be a one-to-one with a folder, or if it is one-to-one; the fact that it is a physical folder may not be as interesting versus that they are being collected and arranged together. If they are physically together it would be easier to retrieve them, but if there is an intellectual arrangement that is not represented at the physical arrangement, that could be worth capturing.","The importance of the intellectual vs physical arrangement can depend on the archive, sometimes distinguishing and modeling both is important and other times not as much.","For the Duchamp Archive (https://www.duchamparchives.org) there are very large numbers of individually described items, but these are not necessarily linked from the finding aid.","Also where is the physical embodiment of digital content, such as where are the cassette tapes, video tapes or harddrives (the physical media) that store the digital content, on some shelf in the archives, not necessarily well cataloged, versus the digital rendition of the same content which may be better cataloged.","Typically documenting physical things, but the answer as to what is more important tends to be an either/or; we generally start cataloging with the physical thing and then building out the hierarchy, and sometimes this is the intellectual arrangement that would be wanted too, but when they are different how do these different arrangements get represented in the data and then modeled into the LOD.","The set may contain a notional amount of items, perhaps it was in a certain arrangement at one time, and then some of the archive was separated out and went elsewhere, and now there is a different intellectual arrangement to represent.","You would want to distinguish the intellectual content from the carrier, i.e. the text within a document is a separate intellectual entity than the document carrying that content.","For born-digital, such as an email, the thinking was that if you have the physical hierarchy as the primary hierarchy, you could not have a digital item as part of the physical hierarchy, as the digital content itself (the email) in its true digital form has no physical embodiment, but a copy of said email on physical media or rented cloud storage, could represent as a proxy the digital content. It could be part of the same intellectual arrangement, but not part of the same physical hierarchy. But you are not able to archive something without having the physical thing, such as a hard-drive, or the cloud-storage that you are paying for, but without such storage (for digital content) then you are not archiving, so these are needed, and could (maybe?) be the part that is referenced at the physical arrangement level.","The digital representation should still exist somewhere, but when it comes to the arrangement, there is a digital space where the arrangement exists; you don’t have a desk where the items are laid out and arranged, but they exist in a digital space and they may exist in several digital spaces at the same time (different copies of the same content or backups of the content).",Are we trying to get a sense of what types of data or cataloging levels may exists?,"It is important to have a good theoretical model that can represent everything, and if we rely on the physical representations (such as a harddrive) to be able to perform the modeling for digital content, but if one hasn’t been cataloged how can it be represented? Maybe the carrier (e.g. the harddrive) can be modeled as an equivalent to a usual physical carrier such as a box or folder.",Maybe the real physical folder in the box on the shelf contains a DVD. But cataloging practices vary and who will be using the model and how can we ensure that the model can accommodate the data.,"Bree: A collection of programs, a collection of posters, and then organized by years, but online they could be arranged differently and sometimes in multiple ephemeral ways; the way that they were arranged digitally could be completely different to how they were arranged physically. The physical items could also have different representations, such as a poster, which could have its original Adobe Illustrator (for example) design file in the marketing department, but the archive would also have a physical print out of the poster which would be stored, so both of those representations would need tracking too.",Julien: Photographic Archive of SSFS,"The SSFS Archive (https://archiv.sgv-sstp.ch) is cataloged at the item level, then organized into groupings, such as albums.","Once the cataloging has been completed, they may be physically separated for long term storage, even though the intellectual arrangement would remain.","Digital surrogates and the negatives and prints. At the moment the digital surrogate is created from the negative, but not a representation of the digital media upon which the digital surrogate is stored. The model could possibly be extended to add another entry point to record the digital media storing the digital surrogate.","Rob: We have seen member of, we have seen digital members of a set, and having the distinction of a digital object be a member of a a physical set and carried by a physical contain, e.g. contains_members_of, where the shelf has some of the members of the intellectual set but not all of them. It seems that we do need this relationship.","The physicality of the archive is still important, as we still need and want to capture the intellectual.",If there are any other examples from other institutions that could be documented they would be most useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or is there another option? ,"Dave: related to exhibition? Rob: separate, title of painting in an exhibition example. Lists are content specific (folders of letters). Intellectual set has all of the contents of the container (these letters plus other letters). Have to go from letters to containers. Kevin: Distinction between intellectual set here and categorical sets? Rob: In archiving little distinction between containers and the hierarchy of fonds and subfonds etc. Relationship between items and physical location not 1:1. Kevin: unsure why this needs a new concept of the intellectual structure? Is there a parallel with the structures we already are doing. Rob: in a world where everything is described we would not have to. But in actual archives, the descriptions are so backlogged that the descriptions are basically zero (just linear feet). Having a set of linear feet is necessary and having a set within that feet is necessary and then having a way to describe specific members within that is necessary. Very similar to exemplary_member_of type. Kevin: need to describe the absence rather than the thing. Richard: Everything inherits from the top level except where it doesn’t. Kevin: Is it always the case that the container cannot be considered part of the intellectual set until members of it are known to be a member of that set? ",Should we come up with a name? And look at examples from practice? Or is this not going to be feasible? ,"Daniel: Trying to model something that is not as strong as “member of”. Would it make sense to use member of and then qualify the membership? Rob: Discussion of if there are only a few examples then do with need to describe a membership? Minting a new sub property was the decision there. Daniel: Would have to change the way member of is parsed if we use it for this case, more complicated than minting a new sub property. Rob: Distinction between containers of members and members is important. ",Rob: in Archivespace find an example where it gets to the physical location of the finding age. How are institutions naming this? ,Dave: Is there a list that archival institutions are using. Jonathan A space. A lot of people are using spreadsheets. Rob: Collective Access?

In translation collapsed to top part and left off links. If important for HAL purposes, could go into Activity Streams. Dave: it is important describes available renderings for the entity. Rob: Activity Streams based on IIIF Content Search API 2.0. Matches the pattern. Context in JSON-LD. “Next” and “previous” on the pages. First entry is “0”. Part of collection with first and last pages. Small number of hits in a single page (short response). Dave: Collection page as entity type is confusing. More like a rendering of an entity? Could be an entity in its own right. Daniel these terms are from Activity Streams vocab. Rob: Activity Streams pattern will be familiar to developer. Expected consumer would be one generating a view for a human from an entity that has the links. Should be thinking in a browser context. Translation from Activity Streams to HAL is essentially equivalent, could build a translation layer to build HAL. Will have HAL form available if there is an advantage. Julien: My only concern is that Activity Streams endpoints for the IIIF Change Discovery API haven’t yet been deployed a lot and are not, to my knowledge, leveraged by aggregators. I hope that more orgs will deploy it.","Rob: Aggregators need to request their consumed endpoints. IIIF is targeted to IIIF but works for non IIIF.
